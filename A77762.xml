         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>1 Tim. 3.16.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>And, without Controverſie, great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs: God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest in the Fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on in the World, received up into Glory.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>A Great and Glorious Myſtery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed-it is, beyond what Man can conceive or apprehend; God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Fleſh of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>For in the fulneſs of Time the Word took Fleſh:</hi> The Word became Fleſh, The Word took Fleſh in the Womb of the
<pb facs="tcp:135138:3"/> Virgin; being over-ſhadowed by the Holy Ghoſt, ſhe conceived with Child, and in the appointed Time of the Father ſhe brought forth her Firſt-born into the World, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Angel directed, his Name was called <hi>Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins;</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>This Child increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in Wiſdom, and Stature, and in Favour with God and Man.</hi> When he was Twelve Years old he diſputed with the Doctors in the Temple; in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> He diſputed wiſely, and they greatly admired his Wiſdom; and when the Time was come that he was to ſhew himſelf to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and to do the Work that was appointed him of the Father, He came to <hi>John to be Baptized of him in</hi> Jordan; <hi>but</hi> John <hi>forbad him, ſaying, I have need to be Baptized of thee, and comeſt thou to me? And Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto him, Suffer it to be ſo now, for thus it becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs: Then he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him. And Jeſus, when he was Baptized, went up ſtreightway out of the Water, and lo the Heavens were opened unto him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him; and lo a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And having received the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fitted for the Work which he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to accompliſh, <hi>He was led up of the Spirit into the Wilderneſs to be tempted of the Devil; and when he had faſted Forty Days and Forty Nights, he was afterward an hungred:

                  </gap> If thou be the Son of God, command that theſe Stones be made Bread:</hi> But Chriſt reſiſted the Temptation, and told the Devil, That <hi>Man doth not live by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth cut of the Mouth of God.</hi> And then the Devil not prevailing by this Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>He taketh him up into the Holy City, and ſetteth him on a Pinacle of the Temple, and ſaith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down; for it is written, He ſhall give his Angels charge concerning thee, and in their Hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any Time thou daſh thy Foot againſt a Stone.</hi> And he overcame the Devil in this Temptation alſo, and ſaid unto him; <hi>It is written again, Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God. And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil taketh him up into an exceeding high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and ſheweth him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the Glory of them, and ſaid; All theſe things will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worſhip me. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Get thee behind me Satan; for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here was a great Temptation indeed; how apt are theſe things to prevail over Mankind? The love of Riches, Honours and Pleaſures of the World; but theſe could not prevail over our bleſſed Saviour, who was the Holy One of God: Therefore we that profeſs to be his Followers ſhould tread in his Steps and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example. How can we be his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, except we deny our ſelves and take up
<pb facs="tcp:135138:4"/> his Croſs and follow him, who is the Captain of our Salvation? Who is our High Prieſt; who <hi>is aſcended into Heaven and entred into the holieſt of all, made without Hands? As the High Priest under the Law, he entred into the Holy Place, made with Hands, not without Blood, which he offered for himſelf and the Sins of the People: But Chriſt being become an High Priest of good Things to come, neither by the Blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own Blood he entred in once into the Holy Place, having obtained Eternal Redemption for us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Christ is not entred into the Holy Places made with Hands</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>which are the Figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the Preſence of God for us; nor yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the high Prieſt entred into the Holy Place eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Year, with the Blood of others; for then muſt he often have ſuffered, ſince the Foundation of the World; but now once, in the End of the World, hath he appeared to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf,</hi> Heb. 9.24. And he <hi>is able alſo to ſave them to the utmoſt that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And God the Father hath regard to the prevailing Interceſſion of his Son; him he heareth always, and if we pray in Faith and in the Name of Chriſt, our Prayers ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Ears of the Father; as the Father heareth the Son always, ſo he heareth thoſe that believe in him and pray in his Name;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135138:4"/> they are ſure to receive the Spirit of Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby they cry <hi>Abba,</hi> Father: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ask in his Name and receive, that your Joy may be full; you ſhall receive fulneſs of Joy, that will give Satisfaction to your Souls, and you ſhall receive a double Portion of the Divine Spirit, and come with a filial Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and humble Boldneſs to the Throne of Grace, and obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in the Time of Need. <hi>God ſo loved the World that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life,</hi> John 3.16.</p>
            <p>They that receive the Dear and Well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son of God, receive him as God's Gift; and they that believe in him, believe in both his inward and outward Appearance: <hi>Ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God</hi> (ſaith our Saviour to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) <hi>believe alſo in me,</hi> John 14.1.</p>
            <p>So that it is not enough to believe in Chriſt's Inward Appearance, and to look only to the Spiritual Appearance and Operation of the Divine Word of Truth within us, but we muſt look unto <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that is the Diſpencer of Life and the giver of his Holy Spirit to them that ask him; <hi>Look unto me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and be ye ſaved all the Ends of the Earth.</hi> We muſt look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that is the Giver of Grace and the Diſpencer of Life and Salvation, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor and Fountain of it. We muſt believe in Chriſt, the Eternal Word, that came down from Heaven, that took Fleſh and dwelt among us; that came in the likeneſs of ſinful Fleſh, and for Sin condemned Sin in the Fleſh. We muſt
<pb facs="tcp:135138:5"/> believe in him as the true Light, that light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every Man which cometh into the World.</p>
            <p>There is a Sufficiency in this Light, which is the Light of Life and the Arm of God's Salvation: <hi>But the Righteouſneſs which is of Faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe; ſay not in thy Heart, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven</hi> (that is, to bring down Chriſt from above) <hi>or who ſhall deſcend into the Deep</hi> (that is, to bring up Chriſt again from the Dead) <hi>But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth and in thy Heart</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>That is the Word of Faith which we preach,</hi> that we might hear it and obey it. And, <hi>if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine Heart that God hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the Means of Salvation, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Working of Faith in thy Heart, and that is the Light within, the Spirit within; It is the Power and Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that worketh this Living Faith in thy Heart. This Faith in Chriſt Crucified when thou ſhalt be aſſured of Eternal Life in him, of Eternal Salvation by him. This Work of Faith with Power is wrought by Chriſt in all that believe on his Name: He is the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer of it: This is the Word of Faith which we preach; if thou ſhalt confeſs Chriſt with thy Mouth and believe in thy Heart that God raiſed Chriſt from the Dead, who died for our Sjns and roſe again for our Juſtification,

               </gap> Right-Hand of God, and liveth for ever to make Interceſſion for us.</p>
            <p>By this Living Faith in the Lord Jeſus, which worketh by Love, which conſtraineth thee to live to him that died for thee, thou ſhalt eſcape the Wrath to come and obtain Eternal Salvation; by means of this Living Juſtifying Faith thou maiſt receive the Spirit of Adoption, and call God Father. Chriſt Jeſus is become now thy High Prieſt and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother, and thou maiſt walk by Faith, in the narrow way that leads to Eternal Life. And if thou haſt received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, then walk in him, and follow his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who was Holy, Harmleſs and Unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, and ſeparate from Sinners, and made higher than the Heavens by Faith in Chriſt; thou ſhalt overcome the world, and obtain Victory over thy Sins and Luſts: And if we be once united to Chriſt by a Living Faith, he will be a Light and a Leader to us, and as a Pillar of a Cloud by Day and a Pillar of Fire by Night, as he was to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when he conducted them out of the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> through the <hi>Red Sea</hi> and the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and brought them ſafe into the Land of of <hi>Canaan;</hi> a Land flowing with Milk and Hony.</p>

            <p>O thou poor diſtreſſed, ſorrowful Soul that art clouded and at a diſtance from the Lord! that art caſt down and diſquieted, having all thy Sins ſet in order before thee; thou art greatly afflicted and almoſt overwhelmed with Grief, when thou remembreſt how thou haſt tranſgreſſed the righteous Law of God, and ſinned againſt the tender Love and Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy Heavenly Father, that waiteth to be gracious; rely upon his Grace and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and pardoning Love, and he will ſubdue thy Luſts and Corruptions, and ſpeak Peace unto thy diſconſolate Soul.</p>
            <p>If he appear unto thee as unto his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> in a Flame of Fire, out of the midſt of a Buſh, when the Buſh burned with Fire and was not conſumed. If God appear ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to thee, as a Flame of Fire, it is not to conſume thee, but to burn up and deſtroy thy Sins and Luſts, which would deſtroy thy Soul. When he appears as a conſuming Fire, he will purifie and refine thee from thy Droſs, and only burn up the combuſtible Matter in thee. And when he appears as a Cloud to thee, thou ſhalt feel Divine Showers of Joy and Refreſhment to thy Soul, which will make thee as a watered Garden to be green and flouriſhing.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:135138:7"/> cryed out unto the Lord; and they ſaid unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>Becauſe there were no Graves in</hi> Egypt, <hi>haſt thou taken us away to die in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? wherefore haſt thou dealt thus with us, to carry us out of</hi> Egypt? <hi>And</hi> Moſes <hi>ſaid unto the People, fear ye not, ſtand ſtill and ſee the Salvation of the Lord, which he will ſhew to you this Day; for the</hi> Egyptians <hi>whom ye have ſeen to Day, ye ſhall ſee them again no more for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when thy Soul is brought into great Straits, then ſtand ſtill in a pure Reſignation to the will of God, and he will deliver thy Soul: wait upon him and be reſigned up to him, and he will work Deliverance for thee from Time to Time, when thou art in great Straits and Troubles, and afflicted, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and ſeeſt nothing but a Sea of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before thee, that thou muſt paſs through, thy Faith fails, and thou art ready to ſink into this troubled Sea, which doth with its proud waves threaten to overwhelm thee, walk upon this Sea and fear not ſinking; thou feareſt thou ſhalt not overcome the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Temptations that are before thee; be not diſcouraged with any Danger, but ſtand ſtill and thou ſhalt ſee the Salvation of God, and he will deliver thee out of all thy Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Afflictions, and lead thee ſafely through this raging troubled Sea as on dry Land: Therefore mind thy Divine Guide, look to the Divine Light, and the Arm of God's Power; the Spirit of God will conduct thee by his Divine Influences; and though
<pb facs="tcp:135138:7"/> the way be difficult and dangerous, he wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> carry thee through; truſt in the Mighty Arm of the Lord and in his Divine power and aid, and he will lead thee through all troubles that attend thee in thy way to the Heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; If ſo be thou doſt return to <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Land in thy Mind, in thy deſires and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then thou wilt be overcome by the Adverſary, and be made to ſerve the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> again.</p>
            <p>Therefore let me intreat thee to reſign thy Heart and Soul to the Lord, and go forward; <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes wherefore cryeſt thou unto me? Speak unto the Children of Iſrael that</hi> they go forward; therefore my Advice Friends is that you go forward; let us go Hand in Hand, let us go up to the Mountain of the Lord, for he is good and gracious who will teach us of his ways and enable us to walk in his Paths: It is ſaid that Moſes <hi>ſtretched out his Hand over the Sea, and the Lord cauſed the Sea to go back by a ſtrong Eaſt Wind all that night, and made the Sea dry Land, and the Waters were divided, and the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>went into the midſt of the Sea upon the dry Ground, and the Waters were a Wall unto them on their right Hand and on their left, and the</hi> Egyptians <hi>purſued and went in after them. And it came to paſs that in the Morning-watch the Lord looked unto the hoſt of the</hi> Egyptians <hi>through the Pillar of Fire and of the Cloud, and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Hoſt of the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and took off their Charriot Wheels, that they drove them heavily, and the Lord overthrew the</hi> Egyptians <hi>in the
<pb facs="tcp:135138:8"/> midſt of the Sea, and the Waters returned and covered the Charriots and the Horſemen and all the Hoſt of Pharaoh that came into the Sea, and there remained not ſo much as one of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider with thy ſelf, although thou hadſt powerful Sins and Luſts that did beſet thy Soul, they have been deſtroyed in the Sea of Gods Judgments, and the Lord hath given thee a Feaſt of Joy and Conſolation to thy Soul, and thou canſt tell unto thy Neighbours what great things the Lord hath done for thee, and hath made thee Witneſs of, and thou canſt now ſing both of Mercy and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And ſay, <hi>Come all you that fear the Lord and I will tell you what he hath done for my Soul:</hi> Here is a living experience. O thou canſt ſpeak experimentally; thou needſt not boaſt in another Mans Line, and of things made ready to thy Hand, thou ſpeakeſt and declareſt things thou haſt found true and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally known. When thou feeleſt it thus with thee, be not ſecure after thy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deliverances the Lord hath wrought for thee of one kind and another; do not think that thou art come to the end of thy Journey, or that thou ſhalt never meet with trouble again but always feel theſe ſweet Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>For after God had brought the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the Red Sea, and by his Almighty Arm had ſaved them and deſtroyed their Enemies, he then brings them into the Wilderneſs to prove them and try them, and after all, to do them good; in
<pb facs="tcp:135138:8"/> the latter end, he brings them into ſtrai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> and neceſſities, they want Bread to eat and Water to drink,</p>
            <p>Thus God deals with his Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the ſame manner as he did with outward <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> which was a figure of the Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> travelling to the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> was led to the Earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> a Land that flowed with Milk and Hony and abounded with all good things neceſſary for the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſuſtenance of Man, as Corn, Wine and Oil, this was for the outward <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo the Spiritual <hi>Iſrael</hi> is led into the Spiritual <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land flowing with Milk and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; there is the ſincere Milk of the Word, and Hony out of the Rock to ſatisfy us; this Bleſſed Land is worth all our pains, Labour and Travel; therefore perſevere and go on with patience and courage, and think not thou art come to the end of thy Journy, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all thy inlargements in Duites, and ſweet Enjoyments and ſtrong Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit thou haſt been made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of: God may bring thee into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, into mnay ſtraits, afflictions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, to prove thee, and try thee, and do thee good in thy latter end; thou maiſt be brought into the Wilderneſs as thy Maſter Chriſt was, and tryed to the utmoſt of thy ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Seeing it muſt be thus, be contented with the will of the Lord, though he ſhould hide his Face and thou ſhouldſt feel deſertions and great diſtreſſes of Soul, inſomuch as thy Soul
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:135138:9"/> ſhould be as the dry and parched Ground where no water is, that is barren and brings forth no Fruit; and thou thinkeſt with thy ſelf that the Lord is angry with thee, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays his coming to thee, and thou art affraid thou haſt done ſomething that hath diſpleaſed the Lord, that he ſhould ſo long hide his Face and not lift up the Light of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance upon thee. And this cauſeth great ſearchings of Heart, and makes thee cry out, what have I done? why is it thus? and why hath the Lord withdrawn himſelf, and why do I want thoſe Comforts that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I have enjoyed? I am now in a ſtarving VVilderneſs and barren Deſart; O how ſhall I recieve again thoſe ſweet incomes of the love of God that ſometimes I have enjoyed! I will put my ſelf now upon ſtrict performances and exact walking.</p>
            <p>Thou thinkeſt by this means to obtain Divine comfort, and have the joy of thy Salvation (which thou haſt in ſome meaſure loſt) reſtored to thee, but alas all this will not do.</p>

               </gap> under theſe ſad Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? If Obedience will not do.</p>
            <p>If thou ſhalt receive no comfort or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment becauſe of the Lords withdrawing and hiding his Face, truſt not to thy own Duties and Obedience, but rely upon Chriſt's Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, his compleat and perfect Obedience. Look unto Jeſus who is thy Advocate with the Father, and Propitiation for thy Sins, and not for thine only, but for the ſins of the

Look, therefore unto Jeſus; how ſhall I look unto him? Look unto him by Faith, believe that he is an Advocate, an Interceſſor and Mediator, and a Propitiation for thy ſins. This will give thee an entrance and admiſſion into his Preſence again, and thou wilt have the Springs of Life that were ſtopped, opened again, the Wells of Salvation opened, and thou wilt come to know Joy and Conſolation again, and then thou wilt declare what God by this living Faith hath wrought for thee, when thou comeſt to know the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming of Unbelief.</p>
            <p>If thou haſt this living Faith, thou canſt ſay to this corrupt Tree of Unbelief, that is grounded and rooted in thee, be thou plucked up, and it ſhall be ſo. If thou haſt Faith as a Grain of Muſtard-ſeed, a very ſmall ſeed, thou ſhalt ſay to this Mountain, Be thou removed, and it ſhall be ſo; and to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>O this living Faith, this Faith unfeigned, it works by Love and Charity, which the Apoſtle ſaith 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Is the end of the Commandment, out of a pure Heart and good Conſcience.</hi> This pure divine Faith doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the overcoming of Unbelief, and it is <hi>more precious than Gold that periſhes, and will

The Hand cannot do any thing without the Body or the Head; no more will this Arm of God's Salvation within, work without the power of the Man Chriſt Jeſus, that is the Giver of it, nor without his Death and Sufferings, but it is all-ſufficient to ſave us with them, with his Death and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Reſurrection, Aſcention, Mediation and Interceſſion.</p>
            <p>Look not only to the Light within, but look unto Jeſus the Diſpenſer of it.

It is not our Principle to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide theſe, Chriſt within us and Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, but to join them. <hi>I have fully preached,</hi>

            <p>This is the Word of Faith, the Word of Life and Reconciliation, the powerful Word of God that is within; as a Hammer and a Sword, and as Fire, it breaks and melts the Heart, and is helpful to every good Thing: The Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had it; <hi>This Word which I command thee this Day:</hi> This Word of Righteouſneſs and Salvation every Man and Woman hath it in all Ages and Generations; bleſſed be the Lord, it is more abundantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed now than in former Ages and Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; yet <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>This Commandment which I command you, it is not hid from you;</hi> But this Myſtery of Chriſt <hi>was hid from Ages and Generations.</hi> It is ſaid to be hid becauſe it was not ſo plentifully revealed as in latter Ages, yet it was not ſo hid always but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it was known in darkeſt Times. <hi>Moſes</hi> might well ſay to the Children of <hi>Iſrael, It is not hidden from thee, neither is it far off:</hi> It is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, <hi>Who ſhall go up for us to Heaven</hi> (that is to ſay, to bring down Chriſt from above) to bring him down to appear in a Body of Fleſh; he was not then come in the Fleſh, yet was expected in many Ages. <hi>Moſes</hi> and all the Holy Prophets, and Holy Men of God, they were contented with a Spiritual Sight of him; they waited and prayed for his Coming; yet he was not manifeſted in the Fleſh in their Days and Generation, they died in the Faith, that Chriſt ſhould come into the World in the fulneſs of Time; and they obtained Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins for hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> is the Word of Faith which we preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was declared and fulfilled in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Days; Chriſt had deſcended into the low<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>er parts of the Earth, died and roſe again
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:135138:14"/> and was aſcended into Heaven: <hi>This is the Word of Faith that we Preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall inſiſt further upon this (God willing) if I have an Opportunity renewed to me: If you have a right Faith and Belief that Chriſt died for you, you will believe it was for us, and not for himſelf he ſuffered the Death of the Croſs; he was cut off for our Sins, not for his own; he ſhed his precious Blood for our Sins, not for his own; he offered not a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice as other Prieſts did, firſt for his own Sins and then for the Sins of the People, for he had no ſins of his own.</p>
            <p>If you have fixed your Faith upon this, and if you have a living Faith in your Heart i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> will open to you, and give you the Comfort of it. I ſay, It is a Lamentation, and may be for a Lamentation, that the true Faith of it is ſo little preached in Chriſtendom: Therefore Chriſtendom is as a Wilderneſs, which might have been as the Garden of the Lord. This Faith comes from this Living Fountain, this Living Root and Foundation, Chriſt within the Hope of Glory: This would make Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom as the Garden of <hi>Eden</hi> and the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> of God; but Chriſtendom is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a barren Wilderneſs, there is little true Faith found among them.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath ſome, even a remnant, that love and fear him, and that are near and dear to him, that have a True and Living Faith in the Lord Jeſus, but they are as a Cluſter of Grapes in a barren Wilderneſs, but the reſt are as a Thorn-Hedge.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:135138:15"/>
            <p>My Friends, Is Chriſt aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Let us by Faith aſcend and dwell with Chriſt in Heaven; let our Faith aſcend to Chriſt in Heaven, and let our Meditation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to Chriſt in Heaven, and let our Hearts and our Affections aſcend to Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; while we are in the Body and in the Wilderneſs of this World, yet in our Minds and Affections let us be with Chriſt in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and let us witneſs with the Apoſtle, That <hi>our Converſation is in Heaven, from whence we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Christ; who ſhall change our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the Working whereby he is able even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf.</hi> They looked for the laſt Appearance of his glorified Body, and they looked for his daily coming into their Hearts; <hi>I will not leave you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs, I will come unto you.</hi> How will he come unto them? By daily renewed Incomes of his Spiritual Life and Light, and Divine Power: He knew they would have but little Meetings at firſt, yet he encourageth theſe little Meetings, <hi>Where two or three are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, in my Name, I will be in the midſt of them.</hi> It is not limited to a great number, the Promiſe is to Two or three as well as to an hundred or many hundreds.</p>
            <p>If a Man be in his Houſe alone, or if he be on the Top of a Mountain, or by the Side of a River, in Prayer, if he be a true Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of Chriſt, and takes up his Croſs and follows him, he ſhall find the Holy Spirit pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:135138:15"/> with him; <hi>If a Man love me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>he will keep my Words</hi> (John 14.23.) <hi>and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that here is a daily coming: From whence? From Heaven. Here is a daily Coming from Heaven, of Chriſt's Deſcending from Heaven; The Father, Son and Holy Spirit will come from Heaven to a true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and make their abode with him: We muſt not underſtand this coming ſo groſly as if the Father Son and Holy Spirit ſhould leave Heaven and come and dwell with the Sons of Men. What is this coming then? It is the Heavenly Influences, the Heavenly Powers, and Heavenly Vertues, like Heavenly Rains, the Heavenly Gifts and Manifeſtations of the Lord Jeſus, by his Bleſſed Spirit in our Hearts.</p>
            <p>So then, Friends, I beſeech you, obſerve theſe following Words, which are of the like Import and concern to every one of us, <hi>The Word is nigh thee; this is the Command</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) which I command thee this Day; this Word is not hidden from thee, neither is far off; it is not in Heaven, that thou ſhouldst ſay, Who ſhall go up for us to Heaven, and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?</hi> How may we be ſure it is God's Command, as well as the moſt known and revealed Truth? It was a Command to them, I ſay to them, to believe that Chriſt was to come in the Fleſh; they were to obey that Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Word of Chriſt in their Hearts;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:135138:16"/> the word of Faith, the word of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the word of Reconciliation to believe that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was to die for Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. In the Time of the Law, and before the Time of the Law they were to believe that Chriſt was to come and die for them, and ſhed his Blood for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Faith is the Subſtance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of things not ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from the beginning of the World, all that long Trace of Time between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> for about Four thouſand Years, they lived by that Faith, they hoped for Chriſt's Coming, and had got an infallible Aſſurance that God would forgive them their Sins, and receive them graciouſly into his Hands when they ſhould come to die and go out of this earthly Tabernacle of the Body, and give them an abundant Entrance into his Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Kingdom, the Paradiſe above.</p>
            <p>But why is this Word called the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the ſingular Number? I will tell you, becauſe one Word, not many is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of all God's Commandments; be acquainted with this word in thy Heart, and it will learn thee all God's Commandments; It will teach you all that can be preached from the Holy Scriptures: This Word of God that is in your Hearts is comprehenſive of all.</p>
            <p>Then you will object and ſay, What need I have any outward Preaching? I will ſit at home, and only mind the Light within, the Word that is nigh and in my Heart.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:135138:16"/>
            <p>No, that is a great Miſtake, to ſay there is no need of outward Preaching; many things are greatly profitable that are not of abſolute neceſſity: I do not ſay the Bible is of ſuch abſolute nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſity, that if Men ſhould take the Bible from us we muſt periſh for want of it; God forbid: If we ſhould be baniſhed into <hi>Turky,</hi> and they ſhould be ſo cruel as to take our Bibles from us, as they do other Goods, and think to bring us over to their Religion, this word of Faith in our Hearts will bring to our Remembrance what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Holy Scriptures; ſo that the Bible is a neceſſary and profitable outward Help, but not of ſuch abſolute Neceſſity that we muſt be undone for ever, and periſh without it: This word of Life that is in thy Heart will preſerve thee from periſhing eternally: O be acquainted with it!</p>
            <p>If a Time ſhould come that there ſhould be no Meetings, no outwatd Preaching or Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or that we ſhould be ſhut up in Priſon, and ſee the Face of Man no more, yet this word of God in our Hearts will teach us, and witneſs the love of God to us in our dying Moments, and we ſhall feel our departing Souls in the Hands of the Lord, and may ſay with our Redeemer, <hi>Father, into thy Hands I commend my Spirit.</hi> O what Joy will this be to us in a dying Hour!</p>
            <p>Now what is it that gives this Knowledge, Underſtanding and Aſſurance to us? The word of Faith in the Heart. It may well be called the word of Faith. An hypocritical
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:135138:17"/> Faith is a Faith without Charity, Love and Obedience: All Faith is falſe that is not grounded upon this Word of God; it is needful to be preached this inward Word; this Word of God within, how doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile us to God? It reconcileth us to God by opening of the Myſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery of Chriſt Jeſus, and diſcovering to us. That Jeſus Chriſt in the fulneſs of Time died for our Sins, and became an Offering and a Sacrifice to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God, by dying and ſhedding his precious Blood for us. So this Word within us is put into us; he hath put into us the Word of Reconciliation. Chriſt is the great Sacrifice of Attonement, the great Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Sacrifice, and by his Spirit he applies the Vertue and efficacy of his Death and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings to us.</p>
            <p>Chriſt being riſen from the Dead, we are not aſhamed to own it; we are not aſhamed to confeſs it with our Mouths, <hi>For with the Heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him ſhall not be aſhamed; If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine Heart that God hath raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> The Brain and Head Belief will not do, it is the Word of Faith in the Heart that begets this Belief in us.</p>
            <p>If the Lord ſhall hereafter be pleaſed to give me further Opportunity, I ſhall ſhew you what Salvation is, in the full extent of it.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135138:17"/> It is not only from Sin and Wrath, and the Anger and Diſpleaſure of God, but it is a Salvation from all the Conſequences and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it: It is a Salvation from Ignorance and Error, and from Darkneſs of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; It is a Recovering of us from a State of Sin and Miſery, and a Reſtoring of us to a higher Dignity and Felicity than that Primitive State which <hi>Adam</hi> was created in; to whom God gave Dominion over all the Works of his Hands.</p>
            <p>We are ſaved gradually; we obtain Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by degrees, and Dominion over Sin, and Power over all our Spiritual Enemies: This is a great Salvation indeed, we are ſaved by Faith, and ſaved by Hope. There is a Time coming when there ſhall be no more Sorrow, Sickneſs, Pains, Aches, Miſeries, Afflictions, Agonies or Death; but <hi>Mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of Life.</hi>

            <p>I Shall not ſpend much time about the word Sirs, which in the Greek ſignifies Lords, which is the Title that the Jailer here gives to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi> He was ſtruck with fear and terror in his Conſcience, and was under much horror and conſternation, when by the mighty
<pb facs="tcp:135138:18"/> Power of God he was convinced of his Sin, and danger of falling ſhort of Salvation. We read, That at Midnight, after <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> had many Stripes laid upon them, and were caſt into the inner Priſon, and their Feet made faſt in the Stocks, they prayed and ſung Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to God, and the Priſoners heard them. And it is ſaid, <hi>That ſuddenly there was a great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, ſo that the Foundations of the Priſon were ſhaken, and immediately all the Doors were opened, and every ones Bands were looſed,</hi> Being in ſuch fear and conſternation, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Keeper of the Priſon gives to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> thoſe high Titles of <hi>Sirs</hi> or Lords, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Not that they deſired thoſe Titles, or accepted thoſe Titles, which the Jailer gave to them. For <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is but one Lord;</hi> not Lord <hi>Paul</hi> and Lord <hi>Silas,</hi> not Lord <hi>Timothy</hi> and Lord <hi>Titus.</hi> To ſhew his Honour and Eſteem of their Perſons, and of their Advice and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in his diſtreſſed condition, he cries out, <hi>Sirs,</hi> or Lords, <hi>What must I do to be ſaved?</hi> Which will not juſtify ſuch Titles.</p>
            <p>But, notwithſtanding, the Query was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and proper, and is ſo to every awake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Conſcience, that is ſtruck with a deep ſenſe of the need of a Saviour, and want of Salvation, <hi>What must I do to be ſaved?</hi> Now the Anſwer is very ſhort, but full and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Christ, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy Houſe.</hi> It muſt not be ſuppoſed or thought that this was all they ſpake, or the whole they preached to

We do not read that they went to Bed all that Night; they had a ſweet time together, until the next Morning, when they parted, being diſcharged from their Impriſonment. For the Magiſtrates that ſent them to Priſon came and beſought them, and brought them out, and deſired them to depart out of the City. Without queſtion there was much Diſcourſe and Conference paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; but the chief material thing which <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> preached to the Jailer and his Family, was, <hi>Believe on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ, and thou ſhalt be ſaved, and thy Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be underſtood that his Houſe and Family, Wife, Children and Servants, ſhould be ſaved by his Faith alone; no, every Man and Woman are to be ſaved by their own Faith, <hi>The Just ſhall live by his Faith, not by another Mans Faith, but by his own Faith.</hi> The Words imply ſo much, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Christ and thou ſhalt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and thy Houſe.</hi> If they believe alſo, you ſhall all be ſaved if you believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now ſome ſay, Was there not need of ſome Preparation before the Preaching of Faith?</p>
            <p>Here was an excellent Preparation, the Mans Conſcience was mightily awakened with the ſenſe of his loſt and undone ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. What needed he to ask for Salvation,
<pb facs="tcp:135138:19"/> if not ſenſible of his loſt and undone condition? So indeed here was a good Preparation; and ſuch a Preparation is neceſſary to have the Conſcience awakened, through a deep and inward ſenſe of ſin, and of the wrath of God that was due becauſe of ſin; this Preparation is neceſſary to Faith. <hi>The Whole</hi> (ſaith our bleſſed Lord) <hi>need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick: And I came not to call the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, but Sinners to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Who are theſe Righteous that Chriſt did not come to call to Repentance? Did Chriſt find any Righteous? Are there any found Righteous before they be called?</p>
            <p>No, there is none Righteous till God firſt viſits them by his mighty Power. What is the ſenſe of theſe Words, <hi>I came not to call the Righteous?</hi> It is thoſe that are Righteous in their own Sight, in their own Eyes; thoſe that have their own Righteouſneſs, a humane Righteouſneſs, a legal Righteouſneſs, ſuch are not Righteous in the ſight of God, they have need of Chriſt as much as others. They that rely upon their own Righteouſneſs, a humane or legal Righteouſneſs, they ſee not the want they have of Chriſt Jeſus, the great Phyſician of Souls.</p>
            <p>It is certainly ſo, before ever Chriſt Jeſus can be welcomed as the Souls Phyſician and Saviour, before he can be welcomed, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and received as a High Prieſt and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiation for Sin, as an Advocate, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſor, and as the Attonement; we muſt ſee our abſolute need of him, in order to our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
<pb facs="tcp:135138:20"/> Eternal Salvation: Chriſt is both the Prieſt and the Sacrifice, the Prieſt that offers, and the Attonement that is offered.</p>
            <p>O glorious Myſtery! that he who is our great high Prieſt ſhould offer himſelf. The Prieſts under the Law offered other things, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the Body and Blood of a Beaſt, but Chriſt offered himſelf; he gave himſelf a Ranſom for us, he offered his own Blood, his own Life, he made his Soul an Offering for Sin, he offered himſelf Soul and Body, a compleat Offering; not his Body only, but his Soul and Body alſo, he offered himſelf through the eternal Spirit. Before Chriſt can be thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and ſought after as a Hiding-place, there muſt be a Preparation going before. And it is propheſied of him, <hi>A Man ſhall be a Hiding-place,</hi> the Man Chriſt Jeſus. No Man but he can be a Hiding-place from the Storm and Tempeſt, <hi>And as the Shadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</hi> And it is prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied of him again, <hi>He ſhall be our Peace when the Aſſyrian ſhall come into our Land.</hi> What Man is this? And who is this <hi>Aſſyrian?</hi> It is an Allegory or Metaphor. The King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria</hi> you know invaded the Land, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away the ten Tribes. The King of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria,</hi> by way of Metaphor or Allegory, is he that ſeeks to deſtroy our Souls and make ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock of them, Chriſt ſhall be our Peace. When the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> comes into our Land to ſpoil us and deſtroy us, the Man Chriſt Jeſus ſhall be our Defence: How? through Faith in him, he ſhall be our <hi>Hiding-place and our
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:135138:20"/> Defence, and as the ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land.</hi> We muſt fly unto him by Faith, and our Faith muſt not ſtand in the wiſdom of the words of Men, but in the power of God, and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is the true Foundation; he is the true Ground and ſure Footing (for every one) of our Faith.</p>
            <p>The mighty Power of God and of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, opening and revealing to our Souls the great Myſteries of our Salvation. Chriſt is called the <hi>Power of God and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. The Jews require a Sign, and the Greeks ſeek after Wiſdom; but we preach Chriſt crucified, unto the Jews a Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>block and unto the Greeks fooliſhneſs; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the power of God and the wiſdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Doth <hi>Paul</hi> preach two Chriſts?</p>
            <p>No, by no means; neither Prophet, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle or Evangeliſt, preach two Chriſts; as if Chriſt within were one Chriſt, and Chriſt without another Chriſt. The Man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus that died a painful and ſhameful Death upon the Croſs, in whom all Fulneſs dwells, the Fulneſs of the Godhead bodily; (he is the living, powerful, eternal Word,) that had the Spirit without meaſure, which is in meaſure in us; he is but one Chriſt, one compleat and intire Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, Why doth the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> call Chriſt <hi>the Power of God, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:135138:21"/>
            <p>I anſwer plainly, becauſe the fulneſs of the divine power and wiſdom dwelt in Chriſt, and dwells in him, ſo that through our Faith in him we receive ſuch a meaſure of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine wiſdom and power as we need, in order to have the work of our Salvation wrough out, to have it begun, carried on and finiſh'd.</p>
            <p>There are two things that we greatly need, that we abſolutely and indiſpenſibly need, <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We need a meaſure of God's Wiſdom, of heavenly and divine Wiſdom, to make known to us the whole Will, Counſel and Mind of God for our Salvation; for all that we can read in the holy Scriptures and other good Books, and all that we have preached to us from time to time, can never ſuffice to give us the true Knowledge of the will and mind of God in order to our Salvation, unleſs we be ſupplied with divine Wiſdom from above, unleſs we be inwardly inſpired, endued and inlightned with the Spirit of Wiſdom and Knowledge from God and Chriſt Jeſus. We need a meaſure of the divine Spirit and of the divine Wiſdom, to teach and inſtruct us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Mind and Will, and Counſel of God, concerning our Salvation; not by Piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal and in Parts, but we muſt know the whole Mind and Counſel of God, as much as is needful to our Salvation, to have it wrought in us. <hi>David</hi> was ſenſible of this, when he thus prayed, <hi>Teach me to do thy Will, O God, teach me thy Judgments,</hi> Pſal. 119.108. <hi>And teach me thy Statutes,</hi> verſ. 64. teach me by thy good Spirit.</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="tcp:135138:21"/>
            <p>But ſome there are that are ignorant and ſelf-conceited, which are ready to ſay, What need we pray after this manner? Did not <hi>David</hi> know God's Precepts and Statutes? He had them upon his Memory, and upon his Heart. But for all the knowledge that he had of God's Precepts, yet he needed further to be taught and inſtructed in the depth of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of divine Wiſdom and Knowledge; therefore, in reſpect of the Commandments and Statutes of God, he prays, <hi>Lord, teach me thy Precepts, teach me thy Statutes and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, and Judgments:</hi> We need the Teachings of the Spirit of God, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Spirit of Wiſdom and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle prays thus for the <hi>Epheſians</hi> (1 chapter 17, 18.) <hi>That the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of Glory, may give unto you the Spirit of Wiſdom and revelation, in the knowledg of him: The eyes of our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings being enlightened, that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints, and what is the exceeding greatneſs of his Power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty Power which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the Dead and ſet him at his own right Hand in the Heavenly places.</hi> We need a meaſure of the Divine Wiſdom that dwels in all fullneſs in Chriſt. He that was Crucified, and buryed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> roſe again, and Aſcended into Heaven; and is now there in that prepared Body wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:135138:22"/> Glorified; but not another Body, it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the ſame Body, but now impaſſible, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ject to ſuffering or Bodily weakneſſes, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Body is not now paſſible or obnoxious to any kind of Suffering.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another thing we greatly need is Power; theſe two, Wiſdom and Power do in a manner comprehend and contain all our needs; We want the Inſtruction of Divine Wiſdom to give us underſtanding and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to know the Mind of God, to know the whole Will and Counſel of God, to know our Duty to God, and what the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us, and what the Lord Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of us in order to our Eternal Happy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And then we want Power as well as Wiſdom; if God ſhould give us Wiſdom and Underſtanding and Councel to know what we ought to do, and withhold Power from us to do it we ſhould be at a great loſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage.</p>
            <p>But God is ſo full of Grace and Bounty, (bleſſed be his Name) that he giveth us both Wiſdom to know his Will and Power to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it. Therefore the Spirit of God which was promiſed to reſt upon Chriſt, the Root and Stem of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> God promiſed that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſhould reſt upon him, and that a meaſure of it ſhould be given to all the Members of that Body whereof he is the Noble and Holy Head; he giveth it in one meaſure to one, in another meaſure to another, and in a ſuitable meaſure to all, according to every ones Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,

So for Veſſels of the Sanctuary, Veſſels of the Lords Houſe, there are Cups, and Flaggons and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Veſſels: A Cup is not capable of holding ſo much as a Flaggon, nor will a Flaggon contain ſo much as a Barrel or Firkin; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in appears the Wiſdom of God, in that he gives to every one according to their Capacity, ſo that none have reaſon to repine and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and ſay Lord thou haſt not given e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to me.</p>
            <p>Grudge not at the gifts of God to others, but conſider that though God hath given thee but a little, he hath given thee what is fit for thee to receive; if he had given thee more, there might have been more danger to thy Soul; if thy Cup run over there is more than it is capable to receive, and therefore God gives that meaſure to thee that is fitteſt for thee. God gives to every Man and Woman a meaſure of his Grace, which was purchaſed for them by the Son of his Love, the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by what he hath done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even by his Obedience to the Death.

            <p>It is good to be thus ſenſible of thy own Inability; and it is good to be perſwaded that it is not ſo eaſie a thing to believe as many hold it to be.

            <p>It is not my preſent Teſtimony to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to People theſe great, important and weighty Truths, That Chriſt is God; That he is the true Meſſiah and Saviour of the World; and, That he is already come, God manifeſt in Fleſh. I ſhould think it almoſt needleſs to demonſtrate theſe things to any but ſuch as are ignorant of them, as Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, to demonſtrate that Chriſt is outwardly come; but it is a moſt neceſſary and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Labour, and God hath bleſſed it with Succeſs to all that labour in the Power of the Lord to demonſtrate to People that it is a living Faith in the crucified Jeſus that is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to Salvation, to believe in him as he lived in the Body, died and roſe again, and is aſcended and is gone to Heaven in the Body. The Heavens, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain him as to his Godhead, which fills Heaven and Earth, but with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Body he is only in Heaven: The Heavens have received his Body until the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time of the reſtitution of all things, when he ſhall come again to judge the World; then all Nations ſhall ſee him, and ſhall ſtand before the Son of Man. God hath appointed a day wherein he will judge the World by the Man Chriſt Jeſus, not by the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:135138:29"/> only (tho' he ſhall judge Men here by the Light within, and alſo hereafter.)</p>
            <p>All that are born of Women ſhall ſtand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt Jeſus at his Tribunal; the Saints ſhall behold him with Joy, and the Wicked ſhall ſee him with Horror; and they would be glad that the Mountains would fall upon them, and hide them from his Preſence; but the Saints ſhall ſee their Saviour with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and rejoice to hear him pronounce that bleſſed Sentence, that ſweet and loving Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, which will tranſport them into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy of joyful Admiration, <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, Friends, I beſeech you, unleſs you would ruſh upon that Rock that will be too ſtrong for the ſtouteſt of you, embrace the neceſſary Doctrin of Chriſt crucified, by whom alone you can obtain Salvation, and eſcape that Wrath that is to come, that will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall upon thoſe that make light of Chriſt, and what he hath done and ſuffered for them.</p>
            <p>Do not diſcourage me in my Labours; a neceſſity is laid upon me to preach Chriſt and him crucified, and a right Faith in him; if any ſhall put this Queſtion of the Jailor, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> My Anſwer is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Believe on the Lord Jeſus Christ, and thou ſhalt be ſaved. Say not in thine Heart who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? (that is, to bring down Chriſt from above) or, who ſhall deſcend into the Deep? (that is
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:135138:29"/> to bring up Christ again from the dead) the Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth and in thy Heart, that is the Word of Faith which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine Heart, that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved; for with the Heart Man believeth unto Righteouſneſs, and with the Mouth Confeſſion is made unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that is not all, there muſt be Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and we muſt expreſs our love to Chriſt by keeping his Commandments, for <hi>He is the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> If any ſhall reject this Doctrin and Faith in Chriſt crucified, and ſay, It will do me no good; I can tell them from mine own Experience, That the Lord hath wrought it in my Heart (bleſſed be his Name) and I find the purifying Nature of it.</p>
            <p>Let it not be ſaid, That all Chriſtendom or all <hi>England,</hi> have this Faith which I preach; for the generality of Men and Women have only a literal, an hiſtorical and traditional Faith; they believe only becauſe they have it ſounded in their Ears, or read it in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that Chriſt died for Sinners, to reconcile us to God, and purchaſe Salvation for us. And tho', as I have oft declared, I have that Charity, that God has a Remnant in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions in Chriſtendom, that have ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the true Faith; If it be a right ſaving juſtifying Faith, it muſt be wrought in us by the mighty power of God.

            <p>Now from this it evidently appears, that that Faith which generally abounds in Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom, is not the true Faith: Why? Becauſe they have not theſe Fruits.

            <p>It is by unbelief that Men are ſevered from Chriſt, and not abiding in him, they are caſt forth as Branches that are withered, and then caſt into the Fire and burned. O great is the hurt of unbelief, and great is the benefit of true Faith. <hi>He that is joyned to the Lord is one Spirit</hi> Eph. 4.10, 11. (ſaith the Apoſtle.) <hi>Chriſt when he Aſcended upon high he led Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity Captive, and gave Gifts unto Men. He that firſt deſcended into the lower parts of the Earth, is the ſame that aſcended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things. And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtours and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come into the unity of the Faith, and the knowledg of the Son of God unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, that we henceforth be no more Children toſſed to and fro and carryed about with every Wind of Doctrine, by the ſleight of Men, and cunning craftyneſs whereby they lie <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>Hence obſerve the manner of the Speech and Phraſe uſed by the Holy Ghoſt; all theſe are for edifying the Body of Chriſt, till we come unto the unity of the Faith and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of the Son of God, to a perfect Man: All Believers make up one perfect Man, where Chriſt is the Head, and Believers are the Members. Let thy progreſs be never ſo great, thou canſt not come to equality with Chriſt; he hath the fulneſs of the God-head dwelling in him Bodily; we can come only to the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt; unto every one of us is given Grace according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt; now the greateſt and higeſt meaſure is but a meaſure. Conſider what is Written, Rom. 11.24. <hi>The Jews that were natural branches were cut off from Chriſt the good Olive Tree through unbelief;</hi> What was their unbelief? They did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt Jeſus the Son of Man; they did not believe in him that was born of a Virgin to be the Prophet that God promiſed to his People; they did not believe the Man Chriſt Jeſus to be the true Meſſiah that God had promiſed to ſend, to put an end to the Types, and Figures and ſhadows of the Law, and to their new Moons and ſolemn Feaſts, and to Circumciſion, and to the Paſſover, and to put an end to the offering up of outward Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and the ſhedding of the Blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices that ſo their Sins might be forgiven them, <hi>for without ſhedding of Blood there is no Remiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:135138:33"/>
            <p>It was not the Blood of Beaſts that wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> offered in Sacrifice could take away Sin: Why? Becauſe theſe were only Repreſentations and Symbols to help the People's weakneſs, and to preſent Chriſt to their Eyes, and ſuited to their weak State, which is compared to the ſtate of a Child: This was the Reaſon they received not Chriſt outwardly; and the Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Jews was great in that, becauſe they did not receive Chriſt into their Hearts in his Spiritual Appearance, but they receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him neither inwardly nor outwardly.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever reject Chriſt outwardly they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him inwardly, and whoſoever receive Chriſt inwardly and ſincerely they alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him outwardly, to be the great Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for their Sins; they own his prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Remiſſion of Sins, through the Blood of the Covenant; they do admire the wonderful Deſign and Contrivance of the Wiſdom of God in the great Work of Man's Redemption; they adore and admire the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Love of God, his Power and Juſtice, Holineſs, Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Faithfulneſs and Truth in that glorious Contrivance, that he ſhould ſend his Dear Son to die for the Sins of Men, and take our Nature and Sin upon him, and be made a Curſe for us, and take the Curſe from us, and to be made Sin for us who knew no Sin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him: <hi>He was wounded for our Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, bruiſed for our Iniquities; the Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peace was upon him, and with his Stripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53.5. <hi>Who his own
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135138:33"/> ſelf bare our Sins in his own Body, on the Tree, that we being dead to Sin ſhould live unto Righteouſneſs. He was made Sin for us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. How was Chriſt made Sin for us? Sin, that is a Sin-offering. He became an Offering for Sin. They that are Branches in the true Vine, and grafted into Chriſt, receive heavenly Sap and Moiſture from him. We muſt believe that Chriſt died for our Sins; we muſt believe that he was made a Curſe for us, and that he ſhed his Blood for the Remiſſion of our Sins; We muſt believe this weighty Teſtimony, <hi>This is a faithful Saying and worthy of all Acceptation, That Christ Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. This is a faithful Saying and worthy of all Acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to die for Sinners, and to ſhed his Blood for Sinners, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to appear in the Hearts of Sinners: A Work that was a moſt neceſſary Work for the Redeeming, Renewing, Sanctifying and Cleanſing of us from all Sins.</p>
            <p>So, my Friends, true Faith in Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives him with all his Benefits, receives him both in his outward and bodily Appearance, as manifeſt in the Fleſh, and alſo in his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Appearance and coming into our Hearts, and by true Faith in him we come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into him, and receive Sap and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and heavenly Influence from him who is the true, generous and Noble Vine.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:135138:34"/>
            <p>Our bleſſed Lord here holds forth a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Myſtery in theſe few Words; <hi>I am th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> true Vine and my Father is the Husbandman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit he taketh away, and every Branch that beareth Fruit he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more Fruit.</hi> He cuts and dreſſeth it with his Pruning-knife, that he may cut off fruitleſs and ſuperfluous Branches. You may take notice from hence that it is manifeſt that thoſe that are grafted into Chriſt and bring forth Fruit, they may have ſome Superfluities that may need cutting off; but ſo long as the Branch brings forth Fruit the Husbandman will not cut it off; if there be any Life or Vertue in it he will ſpare it, that it may become fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. God is the wiſe Husbandman, every Branch that beareth Fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit: He comes with his Pruning Knife and cuts off the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Branches, that the fruitful Branches may grow and flouriſh by the Sap and Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they receive from the heavenly Vine, <hi>As new born Babes</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow thereby.</hi> Thoſe that are in Chriſt may have ſome Superfluities; if we may be as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to cut off thoſe Superfluities and ſave the Branch, it is well.</p>
            <p>In this Parable of the Vine, repreſenting God as the Husbandman, Chriſt as the Vine, and Believers as the Branches; God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther acts the part of a Husbandman. What is the Office that God exerciſeth towards
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135138:34"/> Chriſt the Vine, under this Figure, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor and Allegory, repreſenting him as a Husbandman? We know what Chriſt the true Vine doth to us that are Branches, if we be grafted by Faith into him, he ſupplies us with heavenly Sap and Moiſture: The Vine gives Sap and Moiſture to every Branch, it hath ſuch plenty of Sap, and Moiſture; and Fatneſs in it ſelf as to make every Branch fruitful: There is no want in Chriſt the good Vine, to miniſter and convey heavenly Sap and Vertue to every Branch that abideth in him. We now underſtand what the Office of Chriſt the true Vine is to Believers that are the Branches, and what he doth to them.</p>
            <p>But (may ſome ſay) what doth God to Chriſt? What doth God the Father, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Husbandman do unto Chriſt the Noble Vine? What Influence hath the Son from the Father? We need Influences from the Son of God, but what Influence hath the Son from the Father?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Chriſt, as the Son of Man, needs a continual Influence from the Father, as we need a continual Influence from Chriſt. As the Father hath Life in himſelf, ſo he hath given to the Son to have Life in himſelf, and he quickneth whom he will. Saith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, the Son can do nothing of himſelf, but what he ſees the Father do; for what things ſoever he doth theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe; for the Father loveth the Son, and ſheweth him all things that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:135138:35"/> himſelf doth.</hi> And in another Place he ſaith, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, Is not Chriſt God?</p>
            <p>Yes, he is God, and he is Man too; we muſt have a right Faith in him, not only as God, but as Man: Had Chriſt been God only and not become the Son of Man, he had not been a Saviour, that is, a perfect and compleat Saviour. It behoved him to become Man, to take upon him the Form of a Servant; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved him to bear the weight of our Sins in his own Body, upon the Tree, and become a Sacrifice and die for us, and then to riſe again from the Dead and aſcend into Heaven, and live for ever to make Interceſſion for us: We needed ſuch an high Prieſt, that was ſenſibly touched with the Feeling of our Infirmities, and in all Points tempted like as we are, yet without Sin. That is an excellent Place wherein <hi>David</hi> propheſied of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.18. <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, thou hast led Captivity captive, thou hast received Gifts for Men, yea for the rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them;</hi> or, as it may be better tranſlated, <hi>That the Lord God might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit them and dwell in them.</hi> Here <hi>David</hi> propheſied what Chriſt received; from whom doth Chriſt receive Gifts to give unto the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious? He received them from the Father; he received them from him for them.</p>
            <p>So that you may underſtand that Chriſt is a Mediator or middle Perſon between God and us. God the Father hath ſealed the Son, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:135138:35"/> appointed him to give Bread to all the Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold of God; <hi>Labour not for the Meat which periſheth, but for that Meat which endureth to Everlaſting Life, which the Son of Man ſhall give unto you; for him hath God the Father ſealed:</hi> He hath put a Mark upon him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he may be known from all others; all are inferior to him and ſhort of him, all are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants under him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5, 6.

                  </gap>; whoſe Houſe are we if we hold faſt the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end.</hi> Believers are God's Houſe, he is their Maſter; Chriſt is the Steward of the Houſe; God hath ſealed Chriſt and hath mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him: How hath he marked him? With the fulneſs of the Holy Spirit. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt taught the People! <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

John,</hi> when he had Baptized Chriſt in <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſaw the Spirit deſcending on him. <hi>Jeſus, when he was Baptized, went up ſtraightway out of the Water, and lo the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were opened to him, and he ſaw the Spirit of God deſcending like a Dove, and lighting upon him; and lo a voice from Heaven ſaying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed,</hi>

            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:135138:36"/>
            <p>Now, to open a little further, in a few words, the Relation that the Father hath to the Son, that is here ſet forth by way of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor or Allegory, in this Parable, wherein Chriſt is ſtyled the true Vine and the Father the Husbandman; what the Husbandman doth to the Vine, that God the Father doth unto Chriſt. You will ſay, what is that? what doth the Husbandman to the Vine? doth Chriſt need any pruning, purging or dreſſing? was there any Sin in him? No, he needs no pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or purging; there is no Sin in him nor never was. What doth the Husbandman do to the Vine? He puts Earth and Fatneſs to the Vine, and the Vine it ſelf muſt have Earth and Soil to grow in: The Vine cannot grow unleſs it have a Soil to grow in. As a Branch cannot grow unleſs it hath a Stock to grow upon, neither can a Tree nor a Vine grow unleſs it hath Earth and Soil to grow in: Now God the Father, who is the heavenly Husbandman, he gives Divine Influence and Fatneſs and Moiſture unto Chriſt the true Vine: It is an Allegory, a Metaphor and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, but there is a Reality under it and in it; the Son is planted in the Father, and we are planted in the Son; the Father gives Life to the Son, and the Son giveth Life unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; the Son is continually receiving from the Father, and we are continually receiving from the Son, through the Exerciſe of our Faith.</p>

            <p>O, how many thouſands in Chriſtendom have riſen up againſt this Teſtimony? Bleſſed be God that gave me a ſhare in this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; there is a living Teſtimony that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in my Mouth and Heart to this Day, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt died for us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the Office of an High Prieſt for us, and upon the account of his precious Blood we receive Remiſſion of Sins. All this is by Faith in Chriſt; we witneſs to his prophetical Office, he is the great Prophet and Teacher of his Church and People; and we witneſs to his Kingly Office, he rules and governs in our
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:135138:37"/> Hearts by his Holy Spirit. This Faith is not univerſally preached and known in all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom, in the Root of it, which is Chriſt within, the Light within, that Chriſt in his prepared Body did the Will of God and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Death for us. This Faith, whereby I believe Chriſt died for me and makes Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for me, the Root of it is the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and Chriſt within.</p>
            <p>Is this the Doctrine that is believed and profeſſed all over Chriſtendom? No, by no means: This Faith I can prove out of our Friends Writings, in Print, that it reſpects Chriſt whole and entire. Every true Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of Faith doth reſpect Chriſt, as he is both God and Man: It reſpects him as he came in the Fleſh, died and ſuffered for us in the Fleſh, and as he roſe again from the Dead and aſcended into Heaven, and now appears in the Preſence of God for us, and as he will come again to judge the world, as he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ection, if we believe theſe great Truths, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>f our Faith be from an inward Work of the Spirit of God upon our Hearts, this Belief will lay a Conſtraint upon us to live unto Chriſt that died for us, and to have our Hearts in Heaven, and our Converſation in Heaven: <hi>If you are riſen with Chrict</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>then ſeek thoſe things that are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God; and ſet your Affectons on things above, and nor on things on the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What are thoſe things above that we are to ſet our Hearts and Affections upon? And what is it to ſet our Affections upon things above?</p>
            <p>To ſet our Affections on things above, it is to have our Thoughts and Meditations exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed after this manner: <q>Lord, whom have I in Heaven but thee? There is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee; Lord, my Deſire is only unto thee, and to the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of thy Name; I, am travelling through the Wilderneſs of this World, this is the place of my Pilgrimage; I am here in a ſtrange Land, I am paſſing through this Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, this Country that is earthly, but I deſire a better Country, that is an heavenly. Lord, I am coming to thee, and to be with thee, and to enjoy fulneſs of Felicity with
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135138:41"/> thee: That which I have now, is but an earneſt and fore-taſte of Heaven; that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Refreſhment which I have now from thy Preſence, O Lord, it is very ſweet unto my Soul, that followeth hard after thee, and even faints and longs for thy Salvation! Lord, my Soul is ſatisfied as with Marrow and Fatneſs, when thou draweſt nigh to me, and lifteſt up the Light of thy Countenance upon me; this puts Gladneſs into my Heart, more than in the time that worldly Men have their Corn and Wine encreaſed. But what is all this in compariſon of Heaven and the full Fruition of thee, and that fulneſs of Joy, and Rivers of Pleaſures, at thy right Hand for evermore?</q>
            </p>
            <p>I would not diminiſh thoſe divine and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enjoyments, and ſweet refreſhing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations, which the Lord is pleaſed many times to vouchſafe to his People here; they have large Enjoyments of the Lord's Preſence and ſweet Communion with him; but all this is but a fore-taſte and earneſt of what is to come. Therefore, ſetting our Affections on things above, is to be exerciſing our Faith, our Hope and Meditations, upon that Felicity which we ſhall enjoy after this Life.</p>
            <p>I would not have any ſet their Imaginations on work ſo as to form Ideas in their Minds what ſort of place Heaven is, for thoſe thoughts and conceptions that will profit you, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord muſt give them to you, and ſo help you to contemplate and meditate upon the joy and Glory of Heaven. If ever you
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135138:41"/> have any real benefit and advantage by the Exerciſe of your Thoughts, it muſt be through the help and aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit; you can have no profitable Meditation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God, and Chriſt, and Heaven, and Judgment to come, except the Spirit of the Lord doth work in your Hearts, and form your Thoughts, and excite your deſires, and raiſe your affections to a ſpiritual and lively Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Friends, you muſt labour to come to a Holy ſilence and ſtilneſs in your waiting upon the Lord, and to deny your ſelves and take up the Croſs of Chriſt, and give up your ſelves intirely to the leadings of his Spirit, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the natural workings and actings of your own Spirits, and let every Thought and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be brought into ſubjection and into a Holy Captivity to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in your Meditations on God, and Heaven, and Glory in the VVorld to come; theſe Thoughts muſt be given you by the Spirit of God, you muſt form and frame and work them together with the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The Life of a true Chriſtian is to live above, to have his converſation in Heaven, and to look beyond all preſent Enjoyments, unto that which is to come, unto fruitions that are future and Everlaſting. The Apoſtle, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the VViſdom given him of God, hath given us an excellent definition of Faith.

            <p>Let me add this one word further; the miſtery that hath been told us; the Myſtery that hath been hid from Ages and Generations which is Chriſt in us, who is the hope of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, may we not ſay Chriſt in us is our glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chriſt in us is our Enjoyment? VVe may ſay, if we are true Believers, Chriſt in me is Joy and Sweetneſs to my Soul, and delight and ſatisfaction to my Soul beyond all the tranſient Joys and pleaſures of this VVorld.
<pb facs="tcp:135138:42"/> If I had the poſſeſſion of them, and were Maſter of them; Chriſt within affords me that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>atisfaction and content, that peace and joy, that ſurpaſſeth all worldly Pleaſures. Chriſt within us is our hope of Glory, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meaſure of Chriſt within is not our full poſſeſſion of Glory. I own it, that Chriſt and his Grace is in every Saint, and Grace is Glory begun; it is the earneſt and firſt Fruits of Glory. The Apoſtle calls <hi>Chriſt within, the Hope of Glory;</hi> not the full poſſeſſion of it. Chriſt within leads us to that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Grave, and beyond Time, which is to be enjoyed in a glorious Eternity.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. <hi>The grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men, teaching us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World; looking for that bleſſed Hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Christ, who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi> When is the time of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this bleſſed Hope? At the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of the great God (who is both God and Man) and our Saviour. When is that? At the Reſurrection of the Dead, when all Nations ſhall ſtand before the Son of Man, the Good and Bad, the Juſt and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt together.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:135138:43"/>
            <p>What this glorious Appearing will be, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> mention which will make it a moſt glorious Appearing, that all the unjuſt Judgments that have been paſſed againſt juſt Men, againſt the Saints and People of God, ſhall be reverſed this will be very glorious, and God will then, before Men and Angels, juſtify his righteous and faithful Servants, that have been unjuſtly condemned by Popes, Biſhops, and general Councils and Synods.</p>
            <p>Thus our bleſſed Lord himſelf was unjuſtly condemned, and charged with Blaſphemy, as you may read in the Evangeliſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.62. The High-prieſt asked our Saviour, and ſaid unto him, <hi>Art thou the Christ the Son of the Bleſſed? And Jeſus ſaid, I am. And ye ſhall ſee the Son of Man ſitting on the right Hand of Power, and coming in the Clouds of Heaven. Then the High-prieſt rent his Cloths, and ſaith, What need we any further Witneſſes? Ye have heard the Blaſphemy; what think ye? And they all condemned him to be guilty of Death.</hi> A wonderful thing! that Innocence it ſelf ſhould be condemned as Guilty, and that the ſupream and righteous Judge of the World, ſhould have ſuch an unrighteous Sentence paſſed againſt him, and be crucified and ſlain by thoſe, he came to ſave, and that for their ſakes endured the pains of Death, to purchaſe for them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life: He was made a Curſe, that they might inherit the Bleſſing. When <hi>Pilate</hi> would
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135138:43"/> have releaſed Chriſt, they cried, Not this Man, but <hi>Barrabas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they have treated the glorious Head of the Church, ſo they have dealt with his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; this godly Man, and the other godly Man, have been reproached, perſecuted and put to Death, for the ſake of Jeſus, the Author and Finiſher of our Faith, the great Captain of our Salvation, who was made perfect thro' Sufferings.

            <p>THERE are diverſe great and weighty things needful here to be opened, for there are many Perſons are very apt to miſtake, that have not a right Underſtanding of the Nature of the New Covenant, and they make a great jumble and confuſion between that common univerſal Illumination, extended to all.

            <p>The Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the Gentiles, to whom Chriſt was not outwardly preached, and where his Name and Fame, and the Sound of him was not come, he writes thus; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. <hi>For the inviſible things of him, from the Creation of the World, are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by the things that are made, even his Eternal Power and Godhead, ſo that they are without Excuſe.</hi> And, again, the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Diſpenſation of God that the Gentiles were under, who had

            <p>Here is Writing of the Law upon the Hearts of the Gentiles; and to be ſure God wrote this Law: But with what Pen, you may ſay, did he write it? You may read in <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, the ſame was in the beginning with God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made: In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men.</hi> Here is the Pen; God's Light is this Pen: God hath written his Law upon the Hearts of all Men, both <hi>Jews</hi> and Gentiles, Believers and Unbelievers, for both Writings are God's Writings, they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Hand of God, the Finger of God, or with the Spirit of God.</p>
            <p>But you may ſay, What is the difference between theſe two Writings? What is the difference between that Illumination which is common to all Mankind, and that which is proper and peculiar to the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant?</p>

God's bleſſed Spirit, When is it wrought, and where and how is it wrought? It is wrought in God's ordinary way, by Preaching; when Chriſt is preached by thoſe that he hath qualified and fitted by his bleſſed Spirit; when he is thus preached by the Power of his own Holy Spirit, Faith is wrought in the Hearts of thoſe that hear; not of all, for ſome believe the Goſpel, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Bleſſed be God that hath taught us this great Myſtery of coming unto God by Chriſt Jeſus the Mediatour, whom we have not ſeen with Bodily Eyes, nor heard with Bodily Ears. VVe have acceſs to God by him, and we have acceſs to the Mediatour by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Blood, and by his Bleſſed Spirit. And Faith is a great myſtery, it well deſerves to be called the myſtery of Faith; and the myſtery of it is this, it joyns Believing Souls to God through the Man Chriſt, and to the Man Chriſt whom they have not ſeen with Bodily Eyes, according to thoſe words of the Apoſtle Peter, Pet. 1.1, 8. <hi>Whom having not ſeen ye Love; in whom though now ye ſee him

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:135138:49"/> when it is preached, that they bring a Curſe upon themſelves that believe not this Doctrin, after it is plainly preached to them: I do ſay it, and am ready to prove what I ſay, They that have an opportunity to hear this Doctrin preached, and read it, they have an obligation lying upon them to believe it; not becauſe of the outward Teſtimony bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for where-ever the Scriptures come, and are read and preached, there is an inward Witneſs and Teſtimony goes along with the outward Teſtimony, and it cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that the inward Teſtimony of God's holy Spirit will be wanting to them that enjoy the preaching of the Goſpel of Chriſt, to enable them to believe: It is Unbelief that brings Men under the Curſe, and makes them guilty before God. Our Saviour told the Jews, <hi>Except you believe that I am he, ye ſhall die in your Sins:</hi> O this is moſt dreadful! <hi>and whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I go, ye cannot come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not a bare literal, traditional or hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Faith or Belief in Chriſt that I preach to the People, which is a Faith of no Value or Worth, for Hypocrites have this Faith; but that Faith which I preach, it is a living Faith, wrought by the mighty Power of the Spirit of Chriſt, accompanying the outward Teaching: It is a living Faith, a fruitful Faith, and where-ever this Faith is, Love is; it is never without Love, for Faith, Hope and Love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways go together, and all the Fruits of the Spirit, all evangelical Vertues, Humility, Meekneſs, Temperance and Patience, ſo that
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:135138:50"/> they that believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt they have a Faith that worketh by Love, Love to God and Man. That Faith that they have in them is a pious, devout, religious, conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Faith; and this Faith is accompanied with a Deſire that every one might partake of the like precious Faith: Every one tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> hath it, they feel an earneſt Travel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon their Spirits, that all might be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it; they are zealous for the Faith of Chriſt's Doctrine, for by the Faith of Chriſt's Doctrine we have the Faith of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>So that I do not underſtand, for my part, how people can have the Faith of Chriſt, that have not the Faith of his Doctrine. A Man or Woman may have a meaſure of the true Faith of Chriſt, and be ſhort in ſome matter of Doctrine, that is not fundamental; they may be wanting in ſome meaſure, but it were better that there was nothing wanting, if poſſible. <hi>I long to ſee you</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.11. compared with 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10.) <hi>that I may perfect what is lacking in your Faith.</hi> He did ſuppoſe thoſe that were partakers of the Faith of Chriſt might have ſomething lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Faith that might be ſupplied to them. Chriſt's Doctrine, as it is powerfully preached, hath this Service in it, to help a Man to lay hold on Chriſt by Faith; as you know we can more eaſily lay hold upon a Man that is cloathed than upon one that is naked; we can more eaſily lay hold upon Chriſt by laying hold upon his Doctrine and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:135138:50"/> upon his precious Promiſes, the Promiſe of Remiſſion of Sin, and of his Holy Spirit: <hi>John</hi> 7.38. <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water.</hi> Theſe are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and precious Promiſes, by which we may be made partakers of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>I can tell you ſomething of mine own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: I was enabled to lay hold on Chriſt by laying hold on the Promiſe of Chriſt. Chriſt comes cloathed with the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes, to believe the Promiſe of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, through Chriſt Jeſus, the Promiſe of Remiſſion of Sin, of Juſtification, of Peace with God, and of eternal Life and Happineſs; as Chriſt was held forth in the Promiſe, we lay hold on Chriſt as his Doctrine is preached. As we lay hold on a Man by taking hold of his Cloaths, or a Lap or Skirt of his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo we lay hold on Chriſt by the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous things teſtified of him: So that there is a great difference between common Illumination given to all Mankind, and that ſpecial Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination which is proper to Believers; and whatſoever other Differences there are, may be reduced to theſe three. But though the common and ſpecial Illumination be differing, yet they both come from one Fountain and Root, God, Chriſt and the Spirit, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. And the common Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is of a ſaving tendency, by way of introduction and preparation to the other.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:135138:51"/>
            <p>But ſome may put the Queſtion and ſay, Of what Uſe is this common Illumination? if it belong not to the new Covenant, then of what uſe is it to us?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, it is of great uſe; it is of the ſame uſe with the Law; it is as a School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to bring us unto Chriſt, to point us unto Chriſt. This common Illumination is like <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt his Miniſtry and Baptiſm; he was ſent before to prepare the Way of the Lord. This common Illumination prepares Men and Women for Chriſt; it will make them ſenſible that they are miſerable Sinners, miſerable Offenders and Tranſgreſſors, and that God is angry with them, and that they deſerve to die, and that the Wages of Sin is Death; they having ſinned, Death is their Wages: I ſay, this is of great Service to Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be thus far convinced that they are Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that they need an Advocate and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator to come between God and them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have offended him. If we had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended a great Man, we would be glad for ſome who had Intereſt in him, and great favour and friendſhip to ſpeak for us.</p>
            <p>If we had offended the King and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Treaſon, would not we be glad of ſome Perſon that hath a great Intereſt in the King's favour, to intercede for us? If the King had a Son, would not we be glad that he ſhould mediate for us, and interpoſe between us and the Wrath of the King, and turn away his Indignation, and make Reconciliation for us? Would not we be glad that the King's
<pb facs="tcp:135138:51"/> Son ſhould obtain a Pardon for us, and reſtor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> us to the King's favour?</p>
            <p>We have offended the King of Kings, and the ſupream Lord of Heaven and Earth, ſo that we need a great Mediator; we need one to make our Peace, and purchaſe Pardon and Salvation for us; God hath laid help upon one that is mighty, he hath given his dear Son Chriſt Jeſus, to be the great Mediator between God and Man, to be the great Peace-maker and Reconciler, and the Saviour of Sinners. But it ſhould not be thought that Chriſt hath greater tenderneſs and love for us than God the Father, <hi>Who ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, in the next place, there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing that is weighty upon my Spirit, and it is of great concernment, and that is, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this Queſtion:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion,</hi> How doth God do this great Work, of putting his Law in our inward Parts, and writing his Law in our Hearts? Doth he do it without all outward Means, Helps and Inſtruments?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I anſwer;</hi> In God's ordinary way he doth this great VVork by outward Means, Helps and Inſtruments, tho' he can do it without them. It may ſuffice us, that God hath vouchſafed to us theſe outward Means and Helps of Inſtruction, in the Preaching of the Goſpel, and in our Reading of the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. It pleaſeth the Lord by the mighty
<pb facs="tcp:135138:52"/> working of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> it, to go along with the outward Miniſtry of the VVord, and to make impreſſion upon us, and to write his Law in our Hearts, this Law of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>This I teſtify from mine own Experience; and I doubt not but divers here can witneſs the like to have been their Experience, that God hath, by the mighty power and operation of his holy Spirit, accompanying the outward means and helps of Inſtruction, made impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon them, and written his Law upon their Hearts.</p>
            <p>This Law of the New Covenant, here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſingular Number, is ſometimes ſtiled Laws, in the plural Number: When it is ſtiled Law in the ſingular Number, it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies a Body of divine Laws conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts; <hi>I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts; and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my People.</hi> Now the Laws and Precepts of God which he gave to his People, the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſome have computed their number to be above ſix hundred Laws, many of which were typical and ceremonial: How do theſe typical and ceremonial Laws, which were given to them, bind us that live under the Goſpel? Do they oblige us now?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, they do not bind us as to the typical and ceremonial part; but they bind us as to the ſpiritual part, as they have a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and moral ſignification, as the Law of the Sabbaths, and Sacrifices, and New Moons
<pb facs="tcp:135138:52"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they bind us not as to the ceremonial part, but as they have a ſpiritual and moral ſignification in them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſome few things that remain. In the new Covenant God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to his People, To blot out their Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and to remember their Sins no more. The Law of the firſt Covenant doth not admit of Pardon of Sin; The Soul that ſinneth ſhall die; but the new Covenant hath Pardon of Sin, through the Mediator Chriſt Jeſus, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of ſhedding his Blood for us, <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many, for the remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Mat. 26.28. Why doth not he ſay, for Remiſſion of the ſins of all? He died for all, and ſhed his Blood for all; but it is only effectual to thoſe that believe in him.</p>
            <p>Pray obſerve with me this weighty Matter of Doctrin, which is this: None hath his Sins blotted out, but as he comes to God's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Father's Teachings, but as he comes to be taught of God over and above all Mens Teaching whatſoever; every one that is taught of God, doth know more of God, more of his Love, more of his divine Grace, more of his Power, more of divine Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; thoſe that are taught of God, know more of a divine Sweetneſs and Enjoyment, and of Comfort, than can be had by the Teachings of Man, or in the Bible it ſelf, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that Expreſſion of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, neither have entred into the Heart of Man the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:135138:53"/> things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> The full fruition of theſe things is reſerved to the World to come; but the deep things of God are revealed by the Spirit of God, and the firſt Fruits and Earneſt are given to the People of God here in this World, the full enjoyment whereof is reſerved for the next Life. Now the firſt Fruits and Earneſt are of the ſame nature and kind with the full Harveſt in Glory.</p>
            <p>If thou be a true Believer, thou enjoyeſt a meaſure of the ſame Delight and Pleaſure in Communion with God on Earth that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Saints do enjoy in Heaven to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. O the inward ſweetneſs, delight and ſatisfaction, that the Soul of every true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever enjoys in God in this Life; it is of the ſame nature and kind that the Saints ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in Heaven to all Eternity; this firſt Fruits and Earneſt is but little, in compariſon of the full Harveſt that is to come. Thoſe that are the People of God, that have experienced God's Teaching, know that which is beyond all the Teachings of the beſt of Men, as the taſte of Hony is beyond all Reports of it; the Joys and Comforts of God's holy Spirit, are beyond all that can be declared and expreſſed by Man concerning theſe things. Whatſoever God's Servants have declared and reported concerning the great things that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that love him, the Knowledge, and Taſte, and Experience of God's People goes beyond it. Yet this makes not void the outward Teſtimony and Teaching of holy
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:135138:53"/> Men; for ſo far as any holy Man has greater Experience than I, and a greater experimental Knowledge of God, he is ſit to teach me further than I at preſent know; for the Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren of God are gradually taught under the new Covenant.</p>
            <p>None have Forgiveneſs of Sin vouchſafed to them, but thoſe that come under God's Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they believe not becauſe of Man's Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony only, becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> taught ſo, and <hi>Peter</hi> taught ſo, and <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> taught ſo, but as they ſaid to the <hi>Samaritan</hi>-woman, <hi>John</hi> 4.42. <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy Saying; for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe that are thus taught of God, know the Truth and love the Truth, as it is in Jeſus; they have heard himſelf preach; he is not bodily preſent, but he is preſent by his Spirit; the Voice of the Spirit of Chriſt is the Voice of Chriſt, and the Voice of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; you that hear the Voice of the Spirit in your Hearts, you hear the Voice of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son; they that are taught of God, they hear the Voice of God the Father, Son and holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>There is one thing further upon my Heart, which I ſhall deliver as the Lord ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to enable me, in a few Words, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new Covenant. I hope you all know thus much, that the nature of a Covenant is mutual, it binds and obligeth both Parties; ſo doth God's Covenant, who ever comes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God's Covenant: As, God obligeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:135138:54"/> to be their Father, and their God, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and requires of every one in order to their coming into Covenant, that they give up their Hearts and Souls to him, and to take the Lord for their God: We muſt dedicate our ſelves to his glory and ſervice, and ſay, Lord, thou ſhalt be my God, I will have no other God but thee, no other Lord or Maſter but thee; <hi>Other Lords have had dominion over us, but now we will make mention of thy Name only.</hi> Iſa. 44.5. <hi>One ſhall ſay, I am the Lords, and another ſhall call himſelf by the name of Jacob, and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his hand unto the Lord, and ſurname himſelf by the name of Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is this only an outward Book, an outward Writing and Subſcription? No, that is but little to be accounted of; thou muſt write with thy Soul, thou muſt write with thy Heart: There is a Bond between the Lord and thee, and thou bindeſt thy ſelf to him, and it is written in thy Heart, The Lord ſhall be my God. Thus <hi>David</hi> engaged himſelf to the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.94. <hi>Lord, I am thine, ſave me;</hi> and he takes the Lord for his Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Thou art my Portion, O Lord, I have ſaid that I would keep thy Word.</hi> How can you ſay, That the Lord is your God, unleſs you are his by Covenant? God's Covenant hath a
<pb facs="tcp:135138:54"/> mutual ſtipulation or obligation; there is a mutual engaging and promiſing: The Lord promiſeth to be our God, and Father, and Husband, and our Preſerver, to be all in all to us; and we promiſe, to be his People, to love him, and ſerve him, and obey him.</p>
            <p>So, my Friends, I now commend you to the Lord, and commend thoſe things to you that I have declared at this preſent time; I commit them to the Witneſs of God in all your Conſciences. I commit you to God and the Word of his Grace, to open your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that you may be inlightned to know him, who is the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, which is Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and that you may feel his mighty power to make impreſſion upon your Hearts, by thoſe things that I have been teſtifying and declaring among you; the Lord alone can teach you to Profit, and make thoſe great and precious Promiſes that have now ſounded in your Ears, to have a due impreſſion upon your Hearts, and to become effectual through the mighty Power of his bleſſed Spirit, for the Salvation of your immortal Souls.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Preached by <hi>George Keith,</hi> At <hi>Harp-Lane, London, Septemb.</hi> 30th 1694.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>Cor xiii. 5.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith; prove your own ſelves: Know ye not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? <hi>Or as it may be better tranſlated:</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs ye be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved, diſapproved, or without a proof.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THis is a ſeaſonable Exhortation of the Apoſtle, <hi>Examine your ſelves, whether ye be in the Faith,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>know ye not your own ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>how that Chriſt is in you except ye be Reprobates?</hi> ſaith our Tranſlation'.</p>
            <p>It were ſad indeed if all they were Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates that know not Chriſt within them: God forbid, for there are thouſands that know not that Chriſt is in them; they have not that
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:135138:55"/> Knowledge, Underſtanding, Proof and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, yet they are not Reprobate.</p>
            <p>But who then are Reprobates, may ſome ſay? They are Reprobates of whom we may truly ſay, God hath wholly left them, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left them, and ceaſeth to be a Reprover to them, and their Day of Mercy is expired; the Day of God's Viſitation and the ſtriving of his Spirit is at an End towards them: Theſe are properly ſaid to be Reprobates, yet thoſe that are not yet in Chriſt, and know not that Chtiſt is in them, ſo long as they are capable of Repentance and Converſion, and of being turned to God, and the Day of his Viſitation being not yet expired, it cannot be ſaid that they are Reprobates.</p>
            <p>But now, as to the principal Subject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that is before me, it is this; That it is the Duty of every one that profeſſeth himſelf to be a true Chriſtian, to examine himſelf whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath the true Faith of Chriſt, or whether he be in the true Faith: It is all one to have the Faith to be in us, or for us to be in it: It is one and the ſame thing, I ſay, we are in the Faith, as well as it is in us. I ſay, too many deceive themſelves; many think they have the Faith or are in the Faith, which have it not, and are not in it: This is great folly in Men, and a moſt dangerous deceit, to be deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Caſe. Which of us all would be willing to be deceived in Mony? We are all very unwilling to take counterfeit Mony, of Braſs, Silver or Gold; and if we be deceived, here the deceit may be an outward damage to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135138:56"/> us: But this is nothing, comparatively to the deceit of a counterfeit Faith. When Men ſhall deceive themſelves to their dying mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and fancy they have true Faith, when they have it not, they that die, wanting the true Faith, they die in their Sins: <hi>If ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not</hi> (ſaith our Lord Chriſt) <hi>that I am he, ye ſhall die in your Sins; and whither I go ye cannot come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore examine your ſelves, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine effectually, that ye may know whether ye have the true Faith and be in it.</p>
            <p>It is in my Heart at this Time, in a few Words to open this to you: I have been often upon this Subject, therefore I ſhall not now enlarge upon it. Now, in opening to you the true Nature of Faith, firſt I will tell you what it is not that denominates a Man or Woman to be a ture Chriſtian: I ſhall (God willing and aſſiſting me) firſt tell you what true Faith is not, and then I ſhall tell you what it is.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It is not a bare hiſtorical literal or tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Faith of God and Chriſt: You ſay, you believe in God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and believe theſe great Truths as they are declared and recorded in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and you hear them preached to you by one Miniſter and another, and becauſe you read them in the Holy Scriptuers, which good Men in all Ages have always had a great Eſteem and Veneration for, ever ſince they were written; and therefore you believe this is the ground of your Faith, the foundation
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135138:56"/> of it, and you know no other foundation but this. O this is not enough, for thouſands have this Faith which have not the true Faith: So much negatively what this Faith is not.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To ſpeak ſomething poſitively and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively, what this Faith is, and how it is wrought.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, I ſay unto you, that it is a ſupernatural thing; the other Faith is but na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or human. That Faith that is wrought in Men and Women only by an outward Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, let it be never ſo true, only becauſe they hear it preached, or read it, or becauſe holy and godly Men ſay theſe things are true, you believe them becauſe of an outward Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony; all this is but natural: But a true, ſaving, juſtifying Faith, that by which we are juſtified and ſaved, and by which Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to dwell in our Hearts; that Faith by which we overcome the World, and come to be Children of God, it is a ſupernatural Work, an effect of God's mighty Power, that Power which raiſed Chriſt from the dead. That Power muſt quicken a Man that is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes, and work in him a true Faith, a divine Faith; the which Faith is wrought inſtrumentally by outward Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Hearing, in God's ordinary way.</p>
            <p>Now, to open a little further to you, the Nature of this true Faith, we muſt conſider it both with reſpect to the Object of it, and the Subject of it, that is, the Seat of it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be placed only in the Underſtanding?
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:135138:57"/> Whether it be only an Aſſent in the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, That Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave Sinners? And that God gave his Son to die for us, that we might live through him.</p>
            <p>Now, firſt as to the Object of Faith, What is it that we look to? That our Faith hath a regard to? What is it that we do believe in? Is it in God the Father only, or alſo in his dear Son Jeſus Chriſt, and in the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? Now here is a right belief in Chriſt; We believe in God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he hath given his dear Son for us and to us; and none have a right Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in Chriſt, the Eternal Son of God, but they that believe he is both God and Man; and believe that the Word was made Fleſh, and took our Fleſh in the fulneſs of Time, and came in a prepared Body, and put an end to all the Offerings and Sacrifices under the Law, which were Types and Figures of his offering up his Body upon the Croſs; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>It pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>he hath put him to Grief: When thou ſhalt make his Soul an Offering for Sin,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſhall ſee the Travel of his Soul, and ſhall be ſatisfied:</hi> Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt became a compleat Prieſt and Sacrifice both in his Soul and Body: He offered himſelf both in his Soul and Body as a Sacrifice for Sin; and both theſe muſt be effected by Faith in Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> Juſtification and Sanctification: Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is attributed to Faith inſtrumentally, and Sanctification alſo is attributed to Faith,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135138:57"/> in the Blood of Chriſt, which cleanſeth from all Sin. True Faith reſpects, for its Object, Chriſt, as he is both God and Man, as the Eternal Word took Fleſh; not the nature of Angels but the Seed of <hi>Abraham.</hi> It reſpects Chriſt inwardly, and it doth reſpect his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward coming and appearance in a two-fold Senſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As he came and is already come in a ſtate of Humiliation and Suffering: And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It reſpects him as he is without us, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and exalted in Heaven, at the Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand of the Majeſty on high: God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him to be Judge of the World; all Nations ſhall ſtand before him, and every Eye ſhall ſee him; and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a Shepherd divides his Sheep from the Goats; the Sentence will paſs, and be pronounced outwardly, by the Man Chriſt Jeſus. I do not deny but that there is alſo a Judgment within in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
            <p>But now there is a weighty Matter or Point before me to inſiſt upon, and that is this; That as Chriſt within us and Chriſt without us is but one Chriſt, ſo the true Faith in Chriſt reſpects both Chriſt without us and Chriſt within us; and the Faith of Chriſt within us, and of Chriſt without us, is but one Faith; as Chriſt is but one, that ſuffered for us, and was nailed to the Croſs, and Chriſt within us; ſo Faith in Chriſt within us and without us is but one. This is the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:135138:58"/> Improvement that I would have you make o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> declare to you, as if they were my laſt words That true ſaving Faith reſpects Chriſt both inwardly and outwardly, the one cannot b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> without the other; for if one could be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other, then there muſt be neceſſarily two Faiths: If I might have the true Faith of Chriſt without me, and not the Faith o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Chriſt witin me, then one might be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the other, whereas they are but one Faith, and one of them cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the other. Whoever hath the Faith of Chriſt without them, and hath not, at the ſame time, the Faith of Chriſt within, it is but a hear-ſay and traditional Faith. The true Faith of Chriſt without us, whereby we believe he was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and is the Saviour of the World; This true Faith is a ſupernatural thing, and cannot be without the Faith of Chriſt within,</p>
            <p>Dear Friends and People I beſeech you to weigh and conſider theſe things well, for they are of great weight; there are ſome that ſay this Faith needs not be Preached, for all Chriſtendom hath it, and all the Miniſters of the ſeveral perſwaſions Preach this Faith; a ſtrange Argument that this true Faith of Chriſt without us muſt not be Preached in our Meetings becauſe it is Preached in all other Religious Aſſemblies and Meetings in Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendome.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> no.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ſay, if we may know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have true Faith by Marks and Signs what need we the Spirit? And if we ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="125" facs="tcp:135138:63"/>
            <p>It is the work of the Spirit to intimate to us, whether we have theſe Marks; God hath given us the Book of the holy Scriptures, that tells us, If we have Faith, it works by Love; it is ſuch a Faith as hath Works accompanying of it, ſuch as love to God, and love to one another: <hi>If thou lovest not thy Brother whom thou hast ſeen, how canst thou be ſaid to love God whom thou hast not ſeen?</hi> If we love God above all, and love our Brother, and love our Enemies, theſe are good Marks and Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that we are in the Faith. The holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture giveth Marks and Signs of a Man's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true Believer; but the Scripture doth not tell us that we have thoſe Marks.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, If a Man do examine himſelf he may be miſtaken, though he attend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o what Conſcience ſhall ſpeak.</p>
            <p>You are not to rely upon the Teſtimony of Conſcience alone: a Man's own Conſcience may err, and his Heart deceive him, when it tells him, That he hath Faith and Love, and other Evangelical Graces. But if the Spirit of God witneſſeth with our Spirits, that we have theſe Marks, and that we are indeed the Children of God, then be ſure we cannot be deceived, when the Spirit of Truth doth give us this infallible Teſtimony.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And truly, Friends, I have this to ſay among you, That every one who is come through the Exerciſes they have met with, to a tryal of things that offer themſelves to their Conſideration, they may be ſaid to be a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py People; if they have ſo proved all things as to hold faſt that which is good.</p>
            <p>This is the Day wherein we live, wherein things offer themſelves to a ſeeking Peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, after ſuch a various manner, that truly all who deſire Salvation to their immortal Souls ought to be very mindful of the Exhortation I now mentioned; <hi>Prove all things, and hold fast that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some may ask me; What is here meant by <hi>All Things,</hi> that the Apoſtle bids them <hi>Prove?</hi> I anſwer, They were ſuch things as are of a Religious Concern: He did not bid them prove all things, of one kind or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that offered themſelves to them, but theſe <hi>all Things</hi> relate only to religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>We are among a People that are religiouſly concerned about many things that offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto them: There are many Ways, many Perſwaſions and Profeſſions, and many things that offer themſelves to our Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. It ought to be our Care and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, like the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> to try all things and prove all things: It greatly commends thoſe Men and Women that will try and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Matters, and not receive things upon
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:135138:65"/> Truſt, as too many do in our Days. There are a great many, (as the common Proverb is) that are ready to pin their Faith upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Man's Sleeve, to be of his Opinion and Perſwaſion, without any good Ground or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Conſideration.</p>
            <p>That which I have to mention, among you, at this Time, is the Apoſtle's Exhortation; <hi>Prove all things, hold fast that which is good.</hi> In Matters of a Religious Concern, Matters of Faith, wherein your Eternal Salvation is concerned, go not by hear-ſay, becauſe other Men ſay; ſo but let us all come to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe that Counſel that is here given to the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians, Prove all things;</hi> Try all things, prove Men's Ways, prove Men's Words, prove Men's Doctrines, prove Men's Principles; I queſtion not but you are ſuch an underſtanding People that I need not ſay much to you, I hope you are come to that exerciſe of Mind that you will take care not to be led aſide, not to be prevailed upon by the fair Speeches of any, but that you make it your buſineſs rightly to come to know how to prove all things that offer themſelves to your Conſideration, which, I told you, are of a religious Concern, and are ſuch things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Salvation of our Souls are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
            <p>That which we muſt come to prove things by, is that which I have next to mention among you; this a Man cannot do except it be given him from above. We cannot prove things as we ought, we cannot try things nor
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135138:65"/> ſearch into things, except we know a receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething from above: A Man can receive nothing except it be given to him by God, from above. You and I have not that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that Ability, that Underſtanding, to <hi>Prove all things, and hold fast that which is good,</hi> until I receive the Gift of God I cannot do it: And as it hath been often told you God hath been pleaſed to give ſo much of his Grace and of his good Spirit as he hath ſeen good; but ſome have not received this heavenly Gift.</p>
            <p>But ſome may ask me, What I mean by receiving it? By receiving I mean, when this good Gift is given and beſtowed upon Men, they are joyned to it and made one with it: As it hath pleaſed God to give to every one of us a meaſure of his Grace and Spirit. There are diverſe Names, it is but one and the ſame thing; if we have received the Gift from above let us keep to it, and abide in it; then as we abide in this Gift, in this good Spirit, then are we in a State and Condition to prove all things. It is a true ſaying of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. <hi>The natural Man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. You ſee your Calling, Brethren, how that not many wiſe Men after the Fleſh, not many Mighty, not many Noble are called, but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World to confound the Wiſe, and God hath choſen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty, and baſe things of the World, and things
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135138:66"/> which are deſpiſed hath God choſen, yea and things which are not, to bring to nought the things that are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle, ſpeaking to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſaith; <hi>Hath not God made fooliſh the Wiſdom of this World? for after that in the Wiſdom of God, the World by Wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching to ſave them that believe; for the Jews require a Sign, and the Greeks ſeek after Wiſdom, but we preach Christ Crucified, to the Jews a Stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſs; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the Power of God and the Wiſdom of God. If any</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>would be wiſe, let him become a Fool, that he may be wiſe.</hi> Let us lay aſide all our own Parts and Wiſdom, and come to the Gift of God in our own Souls; and <hi>to the Grace of God which bringeth Salvation, teaching us, that denying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and worldly Luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friends, my Charity is ſuch, I am ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded of you all; I am ſatisfied that God hath been ſo merciful to you all as to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your Minds, and open your Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that you are among a ſeeking People, walking towards <hi>Sion,</hi> with your Faces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward; I do not queſtion but you may meet with many things which may ſometimes put you in doubt and make you to queſtion your Condition, that you do not well know what to do; yet in the midſt of all your
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:135138:66"/> Troubles there there is ſomething in your own Souls and Conſciences that will not let you be quiet till you come to be in ſome meaſure like thoſe the Apoſtle exhorts to, <hi>Prove all things, and hold fast that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is good for all Chriſtian People to be examining themſelves, in reference to Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters that do concern the Salvation of their Souls. I count thoſe that are ſeeking Men and Women, to be in this holy Exerciſe; the Grace of God which is in their Hearts will put them upon it (as it is in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4.) <hi>They ſhall run to and fro, and knowledge ſhall be increaſed:</hi> But it is fallen out in our Days, that Iniquity doth abound and Wickedneſs encreaſeth.</p>
            <p>That which I have further to mention is this, That you will be ſure to keep to the Gift of God, and when you come to know what is good, that you hold it faſt; when you are upon ſearching or trying any Man's Doctrine, if it be ſound hold it faſt; if it be not ſound meddle not with it.</p>
            <p>But ſome may put this Queſtion; How ſhall we be further ſatisfied? We may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed in our Minds, and poſſibly be in a maze, and in great ſtraits, that we cannot keep ſo cloſe to the Gift of God as we ought to do.</p>
            <p>Is there nothing elſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that may be aſſiſtant and helpful to us?</p>
            <p>I anſwer, yes; God hath been pleaſed to afford us another Help, the Holy Scriptures. The <hi>Bereans,</hi> they did <hi>ſearch the Scriptures,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:135138:67"/> whether thoſe things were ſo?</hi> You that are a ſeeking, enquiring People, examine and prove all things, according to the Gift of God which is given to you, and ſee whether any Doctrine that is preached to you be according to the Holy Scriptures: If any Man preach any other Doctrine, the Apoſtle paſſeth a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Sentence againſt them, 1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 7.8. <hi>There be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt; but though we or an Angel from Heaven preach another Goſpel to you than that which we have preached, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed.</hi> It is the Lord's great and abundant Mercy that he hath graciouſly vouchſafed the Holy Scriptures of Truth to be preſerved through all Ages, and to be tranſlated and turned into their own Language; when we are in doubt or at a loſs, we may go to the Law and the Teſtimony, there it no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety between the Lord's Teaching and the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us prove Men's Sayings, and be not like many in our Days, that take things upon Truſt. It is good to be ſtriving as much as in us lies, to prove every thing wherein the Salvation of our Souls is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to <hi>hold fast that which is good.</hi> This ought to be our Care, and there is a great deal required after we have examined and proved, and found out what is good; there are many things to hinder us and turn us out of the Way. After you have proved all things, and come to know that which is good, that wherein your Peace with God and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:135138:67"/> doth conſiſt, hold it faſt, let none beguile you, the Enemy of your Souls will labour to lay ſomething in your Way. If the Lord had not been very merciful to us, we might, many of us, long ſince have turned aſide; we might have fainted in our Minds, and been weary of well-doing.</p>
            <p>I do not queſtion but many of you, in your Pilgrimage-State, do meet with many things in your way to everlaſting Life: Some put one thing into your Minds, and ſome another; let it be your Care, that as you have received the Gift from above, and by the Holy Scriptures, are come to know what is good, hold it faſt. How hold it faſt? By patient Watchfulneſs and Diligence, taking heed to the Grace of God that hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared and brought Salvation to our Souls.</p>
            <p>I pity thoſe Souls that are in an unſettled State, which are toſſed to and fro, that are ſometimes for one thing, and ſometimes for another; <hi>a double-minded Man is unſtable in all his ways:</hi> You are happy if you are come to that Settlement in your Minds as to be ſtable and fixed, that when you have proved all things you hold faſt that which is good. As you have received an Underſtanding from the Lord, let it be your Care in the Exerciſe of your Minds, to live in obedience to the Lord, in what you know to be the holy, good and acceptable Will of God, and not <hi>hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.18. <hi>The Wrath of God is revealed from Heaven againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:135138:68"/> Men, who hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> What hath your Care been? to hold faſt tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which is good? You muſt hold it faſt by living according to what you know; all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Godlineſs will ſtand Men in no ſtead, if they do not live according to their Light and Knowledge.</p>
            <p>Therefore I greatly pity many, in our Days, to whom the Lord hath been pleaſed to give a large meaſure of his Grace, that they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know their Duty towards God, and how to live and carry themſelves among Men, but they are like thoſe mentioned by the Apoſtle, <hi>In Words they profeſs Chriſt, but in Works they deny him.</hi> There are many in our Days that have more Words to ſpeak than a great many, that can ſpeak a great deal, but live not anſwerably. I ſpeak not this to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid any, but in pity to their Souls, and that every one of us may be excited and ſtirred up to live according to what we have received: What will it profit a Man if he know never ſo much, and run to and fro till Knowledge be increaſed? The Lord is about to ſeek out a People in all Places that may <hi>try all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall leave to your Conſideration, and I would ask every one of you that are before me, What do you know of that which is good? I hope none of you will ſay, That you do not know that which is good, for that perſon ſpeaks contrary to what the Holy Ghoſt hath declared, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good, and what doth the
<pb facs="tcp:135138:68"/> Lord require of thee but to do juſtly, and to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God;</hi> ſince the Lord hath been ſo merciful as to ſhew us what is good, and what he doth require at our Hands, it concerneth every one of us to know whether we live and act according to what God requires, and do not ſin againſt our own Light, Knowledge and Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Lord may bear with us a great while, and his Patience and Long-ſuffering may be lengthned out a great while; the Time will come when God will bear no longer; it will be as it was with the old World, and with <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> when <hi>Noah</hi> went into the Ark a Deluge of Wrath came upon them; When Lot went out of <hi>Sodom</hi> it was deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Fire: The Lord ſent a Flood to drown and deſtroy the old World: And he ſent Fire from Heaven to burn the Cities of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> becauſe they ſinned againſt him: And, ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad: Knowing therefore the Terror of the Lord, we perſuade Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I conſider theſe awakening Words and Sayings, I think with my ſelf, How can ſinful Men and Women go on in ſuch a courſe, when they muſt certainly appear at Chriſt's Tribunal and give an Account of their Deeds, of whatever they have done in the Body, whether good or bad? If Men would take
<pb facs="tcp:135138:69"/> this into their Thoughts, they would conſider We muſt die, and as Death leaveth us, Judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment will find us, and take hold of us.</p>
            <p>Conſider your Ways, repent and turn to the Lord, that you may appear before him with Joy at the great day of his Appearing. Let your Religion be what it will, I mind not for any Man's private Perſuaſion or Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; <hi>Prove all things,</hi> prove Men's Words, prove Men's Sayings; and that which is of greateſt concernment of all, let us prove our own Ways, and examine our own Actions; how we have lived, and what we have done; if we have lived according to what we have received, and done according to what we have known to be our Duty; we are in a good condition, but if we have lived contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, our own Conſciences will condemn us, if we be like thoſe mentioned by the Apoſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> Chap. 1.10. <hi>That profeſs that they know God, but in Works they deny him, being abominable and diſobedient, and to every good Work reprobate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do greatly pity every Soul that is found in ſuch a ſtate and condition, becauſe he is in the broad Way that leads to Deſtruction. Our Lord Chriſt's Saying was after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait Gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to Deſtruction, and many there be which go in thereat; becauſe ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</hi> The Lord is pleaſed to afford a Day of Viſitation to all

               </gap> are in a reprobate State. The Lord hath not reprobated any from Eternity, but for Sin and final Impenitency; he hath not appointed any to Deſtruction. The Lord hath been ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly merciful and gracious, as to afford a way and means whereby all may come to the knowledge of the Truth, and be ſaved; I do not ſay that all ſhall be ſaved, for they will not come to Chriſt that they might have Life, and therefore their deſtruction is of themſelves. God hath appointed a way whereby all Men may obtain eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; What is that way?

            <p>If I ſhould put the Queſtion to the moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Man or Woman among us, Friend, What doſt thou think, haſt thou a Soul to be ſaved? What doſt thou think will become of thee? Such a one would anſwer, I have a Soul that may be ſaved. But I would put the Queſtion further, What aſſurance haſt thou that thou ſhalt be ſaved? I am in ſome doubt, I have not aſſurance of my Salvation, but I hope to be ſaved. Then I might ask again. Why haſt thou not Aſſurance of Salvation? there is ſomething that is the cauſe of it. My Sin (ſaith ſuch a one) lies at the Door; there is ſomething within that will let thee know, that it is ſome allowed Sin or Iniquity that thou liveſt in.</p>
            <p>There is an awakened Conſcience, the gift that God hath given to Men, that will reprove Men for Sin; though ſometimes they may get over it, yet ſometimes or other, there will be an awakening of Conſcience that will make

            </p>
            <p>We muſt direct Men to look to the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in their own Souls. <hi>Thus,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Stand in Awe and ſin not; commune with your own hearts upon your Bed, and be ſtill.</hi> If you will come to conſider your Ways and commune with your own Hearts, you may know how it is with you; the Lord hath lengthened out your time a little longer, therefore he would have you come to bring forth Fruits meet for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and amendment of Life, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for the Salvation of your Immortal Souls.</p>
            <p>Ask your ſelf this Queſtion, Am I fit to die, when-ever the Lord ſhall be pleaſed to call for me out of the World? Am I prepared for my latter end? Who are they that are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared

            <p n="1">1. Wherein doth it conſiſt? In a Knowledge of Sin, Contrition and Sorrow for it, and a Hatred of it.

            <p>Tho' I would not Idolize the Scriptures, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ich Man, he ſpeaks to <hi>Abraham</hi> after this manner: <hi>I pray thee, Father, that thou wouldst ſend Lazarus to my Father's Houſe; for I have five Brethren, that he may teſtify unto them leſt they alſo come to this place of Torment. Abraham ſaith unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>im, They have Moſes and the Prophets, let them hear them. And he ſaid, Nay, Father Abraham, but if one went unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem from the Dead, they will repent. And he
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:135138:75"/> ſaid vnto him, If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded, tho' one roſe from the Dead;</hi> therefore to the Law and the Teſtimony, the Teſtimony is in our Conſciences, and the Law is written out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly but effectually and inwardly upon the Hearts; there is no disjoining what God hath joined.</p>
            <p>Therefore, if any one ſhould bring any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrin that is contrary to the Holy Scripture; or, if an Angel from Heaven preach any other Goſpel, we are not to receive it. It hath been the Spirit of Antichriſt in all Ages and the Man of Sin, that hath endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to undervalue the holy Scriptures, who (as the Apoſtle ſaith) oppoſeth and <hi>exalteth himſelf above all that is called God or that is worſhipped; ſo that he as God ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God.</hi> This Spirit of Antichriſt where-ever it is, it ſecretly undermines the holy Scriptures; therefore, it concerns you to keep cloſe to the Law and the Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Let me in true love to your immortal Souls, deſire every one of you to mind the work of your Salvation, and to work it out with fear and trembling, and God will work in you both to will and to do of his good pleaſure: Examine your ſelves and prove your ſelves, whether you are in the Faith; take heed that you be not led by a Spirit of Error, to the Law and to the Teſtimony. If any Man think that he is wiſe in many things, let him not preſume to be wiſe above that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:135138:75"/> leſt he need to come and learn again what he doth not know and hath been taught. Great is the Myſtery of Godlineſs, and great alſo is the Myſtery of Iniquity, therefore you are concerned to examine your ſelves, and to prove all things, and hold faſt that which is good.</p>
            <p>You are a ſeeking and enquiring People, elſe you would not have been here, at this time. And what can inform you better than the gift God hath been pleaſed to give unto you, together with the holy Scriptures? exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſelves, whether when you have proved all things, you hold faſt that which is good. Make it appear that you are good Chriſtians, by your righteous and heavenly Converſations, and by your holy Walk; make it appear that you are true Diſciples of Chriſt, that you are Followers of the Lord Jeſus, and endued with his Spirit, by being holy in all manner of Converſation. Take heed of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging thy ſelf in any ſin, take that Counſel which is given by our Lord Jeſus to all his Followers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.30. <hi>If thy right hand of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee cut it off, and caſt it from thee; for it is profitable for thee that one of thy Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould periſh, and not that thy whole Body ſhould be caſt into Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Live ſo as to be always ready for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord Jeſus, that you may be found among the wiſe Virgins. The Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto ten Virgins, which took their Lamps and went forth to meet the Bridegroom, and five of them were wiſe, and
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:135138:76"/> five of them were fooliſh: Here are abundance of Profeſſors in this City that would be taken for Virgins and Followers of Chriſt, but they are too like thoſe five fooliſh Virgins that took their Lamps, and took no Oil with them, whereas <hi>the Wiſe took Oil in their Veſſels with their Lamps; while the Bridegroom carried they all ſlumbered and ſlept; and at Midnight there was a Cry made, behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him; then all thoſe Virgins went and trimmed their Lamps; and the fooliſh ſaid unto the wiſe, give us of your Oil for our Lamps are gone out; but the wiſe anſwered, not ſo, leſt there be not enough for us and you, go you rather to them that ſell, and buy for your ſelves: And while they went to buy, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the Marriage, and the Door was ſhut; afterwards alſo, came the other Virgins, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, Verily I ſay unto you, I know you not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O take heed that this be not your woful and deplorable Caſe at the coming of Chriſt to Judgment, but prepare and be in readineſs, that you may have an abundant entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his everlaſting Kingdom. Take my words into conſideration, and lay aſide every weight and the ſin that doth eaſily beſet you, and run with Patience your heavenly Race, that you may ſo run, as to obtain the Crown: Let it plainly appear that you are Followers of Chriſt, then you muſt deny your ſelves, and take up his Croſs and follow him. Let it be
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:135138:76"/> our care not to love any thing, not to love our ſelves, more than we love the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We live in a Day wherein there is ſo much Vanity and Pride, Oppreſſion, Unholineſs and Contempt of true Religion and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Godlineſs, and other crying Sins, that it ſeems to me as if the end of all things were at hand, as our Saviour hath foretold, that near the end of the World Iniquity ſhould abound, and the love of many wax cold.</p>
            <p>If your love to Chriſt (my Friends) is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, you will love one another: <hi>If you love me</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>then keep my Commandments; by this ſhall all Men know that you are my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if you have love one to another,</hi> John 13.35. If we have a ſincere love to Chriſt. we ſhall love one another, and we ſhall find that love will cover a multitude of Sins: When we ſee any Man falls ſhort of what he ought to do, we ſhall be concerned for him, and pity him, if he be wanting in his Duty towards God or towards Man, we ſhall not be ſevere in cenſuring him; but when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him or admoniſh him, it ſhall be in love and with a ſpirit of Meekneſs, and as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10. We ſhall <hi>be kindly affectioned one to another, with Brotherly love, preferring one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians, who were inflamed with a holy zeal for God and love to one another, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng forth the Vertues of Chriſt, in a Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation becoming the Goſpel; let us follow
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:135138:77"/> them who were Followers of Chriſt, who through Faith and Patience do inherit the Promiſes, and then we ſhall ſay with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>For us to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I live in the Fleſh</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) this is the fruit of my labour; yet what I ſhall chuſe, I wot not; for I am in a ſtrait betwixt two, having a deſire to depart and to be with Chriſt, which is far better,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.6. <hi>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure is at hand; I have fought the good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith; henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that day, and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his appearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus if we fight the good Fight with the Apoſtle, and follow the Captain of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we ſhall be more than Conquerors through him that loved us, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous, who is the bleſſed and only Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who only hath Immortality, dwelling in the Light which no Man can approach unto, whom no Man hath ſeen nor can ſee; to whom be Honour and Power everlaſting, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <head>A SERMON Preached by Charles Harris, At <hi>Harp-Lane, November</hi> 4th. 1694.</head>
            <p>There is nothing ſo comfortable in this lower world as to be ſatiſfyed by the ſpirit of God that we are ſaved by the Lord Jeſus from the wrath to come; and therefore all who are waiting to dwell in the ſenſe of this comfort, they ſhould work out their own ſalvation, with fear and trembling, knowing that it is God which worketh in them, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure. There are many People deſire to be ſaved from the wrath to come, but they would be ſaved in their own wayes, not conſidering rightly that <hi>There is no Name given under Heaven whereby men can be ſaved, but the Name of Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:135138:78"/>
            <p>This then have I found to be the great leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which I and others ought to learn, how we are ſaved by Jeſus, and delivered from the wrath to come; the Angel that was ſent from Heaven unto <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſpeaking concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Mary</hi> the Mother of our Lord, <hi>Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy Wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghoſt: And ſhe ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now obſerve what the leſſon is that we have in theſe words, he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins; it is a ſaying worthy to be obſerved, and poſſibly may the inquirer ſay, who is it that belongs to Chriſt? Becauſe the word ſaith, he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins; our Saviour is very intent upon this matter, <hi>No man cometh unto me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>except my Father, which hath ſent me, draw him;</hi> Here is one of the marks and tokens that thou belongſt unto Chriſt, that is one that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel ſpake of, <hi>He ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> Again ſaith our Saviour (concerning his Church and People,) in his Prayer to his Father, <hi>John,</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were and thou gaveſt them me;</hi> How ſhall we underſtand this ſaying, <hi>Thine they were?</hi> that is, they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thy preparation, they were under the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of thy power and under thy awakenings, before they came to believe in me. Obſerve a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <hi>Thine they were and thou gaveſt them me:</hi> How doth God the Father give Believers unto Chriſt? he gave them unto Chriſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:135138:78"/> the promiſe of the Father made in Chriſt, <hi>For in him are all the promiſes yea and Amen.</hi> Then again, here is your comfort, what our Saviour further expreſſeth in his Heavenly Prayer: <hi>Thoſe that thou gaveſt me I have kept, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd none of them is loſt but the Son of Perdition, that the Scripture might be fullfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Are you under, or have you known the drawings of the Father to bring you unto Chriſt? that is, are you made ſenſible of the want of Chriſt? The ſpouſe was under the drawings of the Father before ſhe found Chriſt, <hi>I will riſe now and go about the City</hi> (ſaith the Spouſe) <hi>I will ſeek him whom my Soul loveth; I ſought him but I found him not. The Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men found me, to whom I ſaid, Saw ye him whom my Soul loveth? I charge ye O ye Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>if ye find my Beloved that ye tell him that I am ſick of Love. What is thy Beloved more than another Beloved, O thou faireſt among Women, what is thy Beloved more than another Beloved that thou doſt ſo charge us? My Beloved is White and Ruddy, the chiefeſt of Ten Thouſand;</hi> Thus ſhe was prepared for Chriſt who had inflamed her with his love, and drawn her deſires after him.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid concerning <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>He Preached the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, making ready a People for the Lord.

               </gap>and his Heart will melt and leap for joy, and he will be tranſported and greatly affected to hear ſuch glad tidings. As the Captives in <hi>Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> when they ſat down by the Rivers there, and hanged their Harps upon the Willows and wept, when they remembred <hi>Zion,</hi> when they that carryed them away Captive required of them mirth, ſaying, ſing us one of the ſongs <hi>of Sion.</hi> They ſaid, <hi>How ſhall we ſing the Lords Song in a ſtrange land?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it hath pleaſed the Lord in our Days to make Thouſands ſenſible of their woful Captivity by reaſon of ſin, and to ſay after
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:135138:79"/> this manner, alas I am where I would not be, I am under bondage to ſin and Satan; I would be at liberty, I am confined and ſhut up in a dark Dungeon; I would be Diſcharged, I am in Darkneſs and would have the light of Gods Countenance lifted up upon me, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed with the Rays of the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; I am labouring under weakneſs, and I would receive ſtrength, and ſtrugling under my many Infirmities; I would receive Power from on high to do the will of God, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be a weary of well doing; I am now at a diſtance from my Fathers Houſe, and as a ſtranger on this Earth; I would have my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in Heaven, and live unto Chriſt here, that I may live with him hereafter and ſit with him at Gods Right Hand in Heavenly places.</p>
            <p>Now thoſe that are made ſenſible of their ſtate of Captivity and darkneſs, and how they have been under the very region and ſhadow of Death, to ſuch as ſit in darkneſs and as it were under the ſhadow of Death, God hath cauſed light to ſpring up, whereby the Soul comes to perceive that <hi>God was in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes to them. Chriſt gave his life a Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom for many, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> The Soul hath its lodgment under fears and doubts, queſtioning whether ever it ſhall ſee the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord in the land of the living; we have all ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God, and we are all Children of wrath by nature as well as others; the firſt ſtep of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:135138:80"/> quietneſs and comfort, is like that of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thers running to meet his Prodigal Son when he ſaw him afar off; It is when the Soul ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and apprehends that God is in Chriſt recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the World unto himſelf; the Lord ſaith I have found a Ranſom, I have laid help up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one that is mighty, that is able to ſave to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p>Now after we perceive there is a Ranſom, that there is mercy with the Lord that he may be feared, then the light of that prophecy opens to us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.6, 7. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found, call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man his thoughts, and let him return un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> Then the Soul begins to perceive this Morning of the Day of God, and will ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>return to thy reſt, O my Soul, for the Lord hath dealt bountifully with thee;</hi> Until the Soul comes to behold and taſt of this Paſſover, and to believe the record that God hath given of his Son, it cannot be unlocked, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chained from its bondage and Captivity: <hi>He that believeth not, is condemned already, and the wrath of God abideth on him, becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son:</hi> The believing this record and embracing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of God, is that whereby we feel a ſpark of Divine hope kindled in us.</p>
            <p>So that I ſay the greateſt comfort that can be enjoyed in this life, is to be aſſured by the ſpirit of God that we are ſaved from the wrath

            <p>It may be, another Poor dejected ſorrowful Soul may ſay, I have met with many.

We have heard of terrible Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, wherewith many have been ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwallowed up and ruined; and we hear of Wars, whereby the Blood of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands hath been ſhed, and their Lives extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed.

            <p>As you come to enjoy this bleſſed Priviledg, and have a proſpect of a happy End, you will not be much concerned about any Troubles or Exerciſes in the way to it. The Devil, your Adverſary, goes about continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally like a Roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he may devour. He will aſſault and tempt us as he did our Saviour, and hit us in thoſe places where he is moſt like to wound us. <hi>He taketh our Saviour up into the Holy City, and ſetteth him on the Pinacle of the Temple, and then ſaid unto him, if thou be the Son of God, caſt thy ſelf down. It is
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:135138:89"/> written, He ſhall give his Angels charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thee, and in their Hands they ſhall bear thee up, leſt at any time thou daſh thy foot againſt a Stone. And then he took him up into an exceeding high Mountain, and ſhewed him all the Kingdoms of the World, and the glory of them; and ſaid, All theſe things will I give thee, If thou wilt fall down and worſhip me. Then ſaid Jeſus to him, get thee hence Satan, for it is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve. Then the Devil left him, and behold Angels came and Miniſtred to him.</hi> In his firſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, when he came to our Saviour and ſaid, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, Command that theſe Stones be made Bread,</hi> Our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the force of that Temptation, and ſaid, <hi>Man liveth not by Bread only, but by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reſiſt the Devil, as our Saviour did, and he will fly from thee; and look unto Jeſus the Captain of our Salvation, and he will enable thee by Faith, to quench his Fiery Darts, and he will be a Saviour to ſave thee from thy Sins, and alſo from the wrath to come.</p>
            <p>I have opened the Poinr I propounded to inſiſt on, How we may know whether we belong to Chriſt; if we are his, he will ſave us from our Sins; and if we belong to him, we are under the drawings of the <hi>Father; For none can come unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept my Father which hath ſent me, draw him.</hi> And I have given you ſeveral other Marks and

            <p>When I come out of the Country unto this great City, among a People that hear the Great Rabbies, the learned Doctors, the Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-tongued Men, and the admired Preachers and great Wits of the Age; I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how eaſy it is for People to be bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and impoſed on, and take things on truſt, from thoſe they admire and highly eſteem for their profound learning and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent parts. There are places for publick Meetings, and ſolemn Worſhip, and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, almoſt in every Corner of your Populous City; and there ſtands a Pracher with the Bible in his Hand, and he calls upon his Auditors, to give their reverend and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attention, and harken to the Word of the Lord: And the People likewiſe have their Books in their Hands, and obſerve the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures he Quotes, and turn down a Leaf that they may find them when they come home; and go away admiring the Sermon, and the wiſdom and learning of the Preacher, and ſay, he is an excellent Man: But Alas! too few do make it their work to apply the great Truths of the Goſpel to their Hearts, or ſo hear (as the Prophet ſpeaks) <hi>That their Souls may live.</hi>

            <p>We that Preach the Goſpel ſhould imitate the Apoſtle, who uſed all his skill and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diligence by all his Preaching to bring Men to Spirituality, Heavenly Mindedneſs, and to a conformity to the Life of Chriſt. <hi>God who at ſundry times and in divers man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſpake in time paſt unto the Fathers, by the Prophets, hath in theſe laſt days, ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Who being the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, and upholding all things by the Word of his Power, when he had by himſelf purged our Sins, ſat down on the right Hand of the Majeſty on high.</hi> Thus he begins his

            </p>
            <p>It is the end and deſign of our Preaching the Goſpel, to bring Men to the ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Chriſt, and him Crucified, and to turn them from the Power of Satan to the Power of God. There is a complaint of ſome that are Preachers in this City, and other places (and I fear there is too much cauſe for it) that they only Preach Chriſt within, and the Light within, but do not make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Death and ſufferings of Chriſt, and the benefits that come to believers by his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and ſatisfaction; for he that knew no Sin was made Sin, for us that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him; and he was wounded for our Transgreſſions,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:135138:91"/> bruiſed for our iniquities, and the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes we are healed. <hi>Without contro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>verſy</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>great is the Miſtery of godlineſs; God was Manifest in the Fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, Preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the World, and received up into Glory.</hi> The Prophets ſpake of Chriſts coming in our nature, and being manifeſt in Fleſh in that Body prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for him, to do the will of God.

            <p>I have many times been aſtoniſhed, when I have conſidered the wonderful Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eternal Son of God, who being in the form of God, thought it not Robbery to be equal with God, but made himſelf of no Reputation, and took upon him the form of a Servant, and was made in the likeneſs of Men; and being found in faſhion as a Man, he humbled himſelf and became obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto Death, even the Death of the Croſs.</p>
            <p>I have ſearched ſolemnly into this Myſtery for my ſatisfaction, with reſpect to his bodily and outward appearance; and I have thought with my ſelf, God hath been pleaſed in his moſt wonderful kindneſs and compaſſion, to condeſcend to our weakneſs and infirmity, and help our unbelief; and leſt People ſhould be ready to queſtion Gods Veracity, and not believe what is reported by the Angel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt, and Salvation to be obtained by his Death and ſufferings, and what was foretold by the Prophets; God ſent his Son into the World, that Men might ſee him Face to Face, and hear him Preach to them with his own Mouth, who had Grace poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Lips, that they might be convinced and converted by his heavenly Doctrin; who had the words of Eternal Life; for ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Power appeared in his Preaching, that many which heard him were ſtricken with wonder and ſaid, <hi>Never Man ſpake like this Man.</hi>

Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſaith unto her, Mary: She turned her ſelf, and ſaith unto him, Rabboni, which is to ſay, Maſter. Jeſus ſaith unto her, touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended to my Father; but go to my Father, and your Father, and to my God, and your God. Mary Magdalen came and told the Diſciples, That ſhe had ſeen the Lord, and that he had ſpoken theſe things unto her. Then the ſame Day, at the Evening, being the firſt Day of the Week, when the Doors were ſhut, where his Diſciples were aſſembled for fear of the Jews, came Jeſus and ſtood in the midſt, and ſaid; Peace be unto you: And he ſhewed them his Hands, and his ſide. And the Diſciples were glad when they ſaw the Lord; but</hi> Thomas <hi>was not with them when Jeſus came. The other Diſciples ſaid unto him, We have ſeen the Lord: But he ſaid unto them, except I ſee in his Hand the Print of the Nails, and put my Finger into the Print of the Nails, and thruſt my Hand into his ſide, I will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. And after eight Days, his Diſciples were within, and</hi> Thomas <hi>with them; then came Jeſus, the Doors being ſhut, and ſaid, Peace be unto you. Then ſaith he to</hi> Thomas, <hi>reach hither thy Finger, and behold my Hands; and reach hither thy Hands; and thruſt it into my ſide, and be not faithleſs, but believing.

            </p>
            <p>To confirm our belief of theſe great and wonderful things recorded in the Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> the Evangeliſt writes after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>Foraſmuch as many have taken in Hand to ſet forth in order, a Declaration of thoſe things which are moſt ſurely believed among us, even as they delivered them to us, which from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were Eye-Witneſſes and Miniſters of the World; it ſeemed good unto me alſo, to write unto thee moſt excellent</hi> Theophilus, <hi>that thou mighteſt know the certainty of thoſe things, wherein thou haſt been inſtructed.</hi>

            <pb n="188" facs="tcp:135138:95"/>
            <p>And therefore it may well enough in part be underſtood as the Senſe and meaning of theſe words of the Apoſtle (though I own there is more in it) when he ſaid to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians I travel, in Birth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it may well enough be underſtood, as if he had ſaid, whereas formerly I traveled for my ſelf that Chriſt might be formed in me, now I travel again till Chriſt be formed in you: We can neither rightly, nor profitably and effectually Witneſs for the Salvation of others, and be in labour or travail for the Salvation of others, until Chriſt be formed in us; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we know a travail for our own Salvation, until we can witneſs our own Salvation to be wrought and carried on, and not only begun in us; and then we ſhall with good ſucceſs preach the Goſpel, and without this no hope of ſucceſs. Let Men preach ever ſo much in a form of ſound words, yet they cannot preach with hope of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>I ſay, further, it may have this further ſenſe that whereas <hi>Paul</hi> had formerly laboured among theſe <hi>Galatians,</hi> and God had bleſſed his labours, ſo that there was a good degree of the Work of God begun in them, there had been a good Foundation laid, the Seed had not only been Sown, but had taken Root; and not only taken Roor, but ſprung up, in ſome meaſure. But ſome falſe teachers coming after <hi>Paul,</hi> and gaining too much ground on the affections of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> they had too much undone, as it were, that which he had been doing; they had in ſome
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:135138:95"/> meaſure and degree marr'd and ſpoiled, and, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s it were, undone that which had been done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore; therefore, he complains and expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with them, by way of Lamentation, after this manner: <hi>O Fooliſh Galatians! who hath bewitched you, that you ſhould not obey the Truth! before whoſe Eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth, Crucified among you. This only would I learn of you; received ye the Spirit by the Works of the Law, or by the bearing of Faith?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe that they had commended and eſteemed as Miniſters of Chriſt, laboured to bring them back to the Law, and to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Rites and Ceremonies, to obſerve days and times and ſuch things; <hi>I am afraid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have laboured among you in vain, leſt that be marr'd and hurt in you, and you ſuffer loſs in that which I laboured for, and made evident to you.</hi> And therefore, the Apoſtle laboured the ſecond time, that that might be recovered in them and gained, which had ſuffered loſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment.</p>
            <p>But now to ſpeak ſomewhat more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to the Matter it ſelf, which ſhall be by anſwering a weighty queſtion: Which is this.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>What is it to have Chriſt formed in a Man or Woman?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in order to the anſwering of this Queſtion, it is in my Heart to make uſe of that Parable of our bleſſed Lord, as we find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:135138:96"/> of God is likened unto a Grain of Corn unto Seed, Wheat or other Grain, which a Man Sows in his Field, and it ſpringeth firſt into the Blade, then into the Ear, and laſt of all it comes to ripe Fruit. Now as to the Seed of Corn to which he compares the Kingdom of God, it is certain, that which the Scripture calls incorruptible Seed, is a Seed of God, which comes from him imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, as I may ſay, and yet comes to us, through Chriſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in him, and he cannot Sin becauſe he is born of God,</hi> Now the Seed of God, which is called the Kingdom of God, is compared to a Grain of Corn, and all Seeds muſt have a Soil and Earth to grow in: What is the Soil where the Seed of God grows? It is the Hearts and Souls of Men and Women, and their inward Parts. Now you know the Earth is full of Weeds, and of Bryars, and Thorns, therefore the Husband-man takes pains to cut up, and root up, thoſe Weeds and Tares, to keep his ground clean, that ſo the clean Seed may grow and come to ripeneſs and maturity. So it is very ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and uſual for the Husband-Man to Weed his Corn, when the Corn is young, as I have ſeen it practiced, and thoſe that go to Weed the Corn muſt be very tender, leſt they ttead under Foot the Corn and tender Plants; they muſt do it carefully, tenderly and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, leſt they do more hurt than good; ſo they have their Weeding-Hooks and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

            <p>Now as concerning the ſtate of the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> I told you, That <hi>Paul</hi> had laboured among rhem with ſucceſs; but other Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers came among them, by whom they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hurt, and ſuffered loſs and detriment ſo that they needed a <hi>New Viſitation</hi> and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, that all might not be deſtroyed tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> had been building up in them; they had
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:135138:98"/> ſuffered that loſs and damage that they needed <hi>Paul</hi>'s Miniſtry to bring them to an Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment in the truth, that they might ſtand in ſearching and ſhaking times.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, in Harveſt, there may ariſe ſuch tempeſtuous Winds, as may ſhake the Corn: So ſuch ſhaking and ſearching times may come, as to try and terrify God's People, and ſhake God's Corn before it be gathered into the Lord's Barn. It is good to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring for ſuch things, and making ready; and to be earneſt with the Lord to prepare us, that if ſhaking Winds ſhall come, we may be preſerved <hi>ſtedfaſt and unmovable, and abounding in the Work of the Lord, that our labour may not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> If it ſhall be ſo that many ſhall be ſhaken, ſuch times may come, let us prepare and make ready, that we may not be ſurprized, but preſerved in ſhaking times; and thoſe that ſhall be preſerved unſhaken, when the Winds of Mens Doctrins ſhall blow upon them, let them bleſs and praiſe the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. <hi>That our Lord Jeſus Chriſt aſcended up far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all Heavens, that he might fill all things: And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the Work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Faith, and of the knowledg of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man, unto the meaſure of the Stature of the fulneſs of Chriſt; That
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:135138:99"/> we henceforth be no more Children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every Wind of Doctrin, by the ſlight of Men, and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> There is nothing but the Lord's Power is able to preſerve us; if we truſt in the Lord, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him, he will preſerve us, and be unto us as the ſhadow of a great Rock in a weary Land. We ſhall be preſerved, if we keep in the living exerciſe of Faith, if we do not live in the daily exerciſe of Faith, we ſhall be as Corn on the Houſe top ſhaken, and bring forth no good Fruit in ſeaſon. Let us live in the Exerciſe of faith, and depend on God for the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, and them we ſhall be preſerved in ſhaking times.</p>
            <p>Now to ſpeak a little further, concerning this great and weighty Matter, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſaid, that in Regeneration there is an infuſing of certain Habits of Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Love into the Soul; but this is not the manner of their Doctrin, who are called Quakers, nor of my Doctrin, nor agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the holy Scriptures, to ſay, That Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of Grace are infuſed into the Soul. The Scripture calls it, <hi>The Life of God,</hi> which is better and more than Habits. There is a Principle of divine Life communicated to the Soul in Regeneration, a meaſure of the divine Nature, which is indeed fitly called, <hi>The Life of God,</hi> that actuates, and enlivens the Soul, and is united to it, as the Soul doth animate and act in the Body, to which it is united, the which union of the divine Life with the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:135138:99"/> Soul, is by the Souls Faith and Love to God and Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is that which I have had experience of, and I have not loſt it, whatſoever ſome have ſaid. I feel a Principle of divine Life acting in my Soul, as my Soul acts in my Body; this is Chriſt formed within us. How doth the Soul put forth ſuch noble and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Actings, and rule and actuate the Body? The Body muſt be organized, have its due Organs prepared, that the Soul may act in us, and exert its vital Power and Motions in us. As the Soul of Man actuates the Body, to bring forth the proper Operations of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Life, ſo the divine Life, the Life of Chriſt, doth actuate the Soul in all heavenly and ſpiritual Acts and Operations.</p>
            <p>So that I am for preaching the Light within, and Chriſt within the hope of glory, but not ſo as to draw your Minds from Chriſt without, from what he hath done and ſuffered for us on Earth, and what now he is doing for us in Heaven; for as he hath died for us, and made his Soul an offering for Sin, and ſatisfied divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and became a Sacrifice to God of a ſweet ſmelling Savour, ſo he liveth for ever in Heaven, to make interceſſion for us.</p>
            <p>So I would not have your minds drawn from the Light within, from Chriſt within, by what is preached of Chriſt without; but I would have you make a due improvement both of one and the other; which cannot be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eparated, but are always united and joyned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ogether in a Right Preaching of the Goſpel.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:135138:100"/> I know the Doctrin of Chriſt crucified may be perverted and abuſed by ſome, and the grace of God turned into wantonneſs; but there is no tendency in the Doctrin of Chriſt without us of what he did and ſuffered for us, there is no tendency in this Doctrin to draw the Minds of any from minding the Work of God within, the Seed of God within, and Chriſt within. As this Doctrin hath no ſuch tendency, ſo I do appeal to God the ſearcher of Hearts, and the righteous Judg of Heaven and Earth, that I have no deſign nor intention, to draw any Man by my Preaching Chriſt without, from Chriſt within, from the Light and Grace of God within us, and the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God within.</p>
            <p>O! it is the breathing of my Soul to God, and my Hearts deſire and Prayer; that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of us may feel and enjoy, by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward experience, more of the Light and Grace of God within, and of Chriſt within, then there would not be ſuch hard thoughts and hard ſpeeches, and ſuch raſh and unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table judging and cenſuring one another. The Lord grant we may learn of Chriſt, who when he was reviled, reviled not again; and when he ſuffered, he threatned not; but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
            <p>I have anſwered one weighty queſtion; What it is to have Chriſt formed in us. It is to have a meaſure of the Divine Nature, a meaſure of the divine Life, acting in the Souls of the Lords People; Chriſts Life ruling in
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:135138:100"/> the Soul, and acting in the Soul, as the Soul acts in the Body. The Body cannot govern it ſelf, but ſo long as the Soul lives and dwells in the Body, and is united to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, it carries the Body whether it will. So when this precious Life of Chriſt liveth and acteth in the Soul, the Soul is ſubjected to it; it ruleth the whole Man, it ruleth his Soul more immediately. Now another girdeth us, and we do not gird our ſelves, and we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that which our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> John 21.18. <hi>Verily I ſay unto thee, when thou waſt young thou girdedst thy ſelf, and walkedſt whether thou wouldeſt; but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy Hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldeſt not.</hi> When we are come to Chriſt, and when once Chriſt is formed in us (though we followed our own corrupt Wills and Inclinations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) then we muſt be governed by Chriſt, and act according to this noble and divine Principle, and ſay with the Apoſtle; <hi>I live; yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now come very briefly to anſwer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Queſtion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſtion</hi> 2. By what means is this divine Birth, this Spiritual and Divine Life of Chriſt, produced and brought forth in us? <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> There is a natural Birth that hath fleſh for the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of it. But there is a divine and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Birth, a being born again, and born of the Spirit. How is this wrought and effected?</p>
            <pb n="200" facs="tcp:135138:101"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Partly by an outward Miniſtry of Gods fitting, qualifying and ſending; yet it is far from me to affirm, there is an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity to depend upon an outward Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. There is a difference between God's ordinary way of forming Chriſt, within us, and God's extraordinary Way and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to do what he pleaſeth: God can work without Means, as well as with Means: But in Gods ordinary way, he is pleaſed, by the fooliſhneſs of Preaching, to ſave them that believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23, 24. <hi>We Preach Chriſt crucified</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>unto the Jews a ſtumbling block, and unto the Greeks Fooliſhneſs; but unto shem which are called both Jews and Greeks, Chriſt the Power of God, and the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and they ſpend themſelves, and are ſpent in their carrying on the Work of the Goſpel, for the Salvation of the Souls of their hearers: They have a holy labour and travail continually upon them; they do not ſpeak words barely from their Brains, and from other Men's Lines, and things made ready to their Hands, but they labour Night and day that Souls may be converted and ſaved. They are as inſtruments in Chriſt's Hand for the forming of Chriſt, in the Souls of People; the Holy Ghoſt is the Mother of the New Birth.</p>
            <p>Pray that you may have Faith in the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and you ſhall abundantly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of his Spirit. <hi>John</hi> 7.37, 38, <hi>In that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:135138:101"/> laſt Day, the great Day of the Feaſt, Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any Man Thirſt, let him come unto me and drink. He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water. But this ſpake he of the Spirit, which they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him ſhould receive.</hi> This Faith in Chriſt here ſpoken of, doth reſpect Chriſt as God and Man; not only as God from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but as he is the Son of Man: <hi>As Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs; even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up.</hi> It is not barely a literal, traditional or Hiſtorical Faith, but a Faith wrought by the mighty Power of God, that we witneſs, through the Power of the moſt High coming upon us, and the over-ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt. As it was ſaid to the bleſſed Virgin the Mother of our Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 35. <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the Power of the higheſt ſhall over-ſhadow thee; therefore, alſo, that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee, ſhall be called the Son of God.</hi> We ſhall feel but in ſome far inferior manner the Holy Ghoſt to come upon us, and the Power of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to Over-ſhadow us, as Chriſt is formed in us.</p>

            <p>I Am under an oppreſſion of Spirit at this time, being ſenſible that there are many that have left their firſt love, and have fallen from a State of Purity and Holineſs which once they were poſſeſſors of, and are come to be like the Prodigal Son, who received his Portion from his Father and took his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny into a far Country, and there waſted his ſubſtance with riotous living. O how glad ſhould my Soul be, that ſome of theſe Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals might be awakened, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member from whence they are fallen, and call to mind how it was with them when they were in their Father's Houſe, when they were fed at their Fathers Table. O my Soul is grieved with a Senſe of their woful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in a ſenſe of that Famin of the Word of the Lord that is come over them, in a Senſe of
<pb facs="tcp:135138:102"/> that darkneſs, and deadneſs, and barrenneſs that is come over their immortal Souls. O! that they might be awakened by the Power and Spirit of the Lord, that they might come to themſelves, as the prodigal Son did, when he had ſpent all; and when there aroſe a mighty Famine in that Land, and he began to be in want, and went and joyned himſelf to a Citizen of that Country, who ſent him into the Fields to feed Swine, and he would fain have filled his Belly with the Husks that the Swine did Eat, and no man gave unto him.</p>
            <p>It is not Husks that will ſatisfy thy hungry Soul, when once thou art convinced and awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to conſider thy miſerable condition; it is not an empty talk of Religion, which is but as Husks, and cannot ſatisfy thy Hungry Soul. If thou art awakened and come to thy ſelf, thou wilt repent and mourn for thy Sin, and lament and grieve, and mourn over him whom thou haſt pierced by thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions; then thou wilt take up a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Prodigal who when he came to himſelf he ſaid, <hi>How many hired Servants of my Fathers, have Bread enough and to ſpare, and I periſh with hunger? I will ariſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and go to my Father, and will ſay unto him, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me as one of thy hired Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Say to thy heavenly Father in thy humble Confeſſion of Sin, Lord I have been a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, I have waſted thy heavenly Treaſure, I have ſpent and trifled away my precious
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:135138:103"/> Time in a ſtrange land, and have fed among Swiniſh Sinners; I cannot fill my belly with theſe Husks. Now <hi>I</hi> remember the plenty of my Fathers Houſe, where I had Bread enough and to ſpare, I will return and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble my ſelf before my Father, I will confeſs my ſin and Folly unto my compaſſionate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; it may be he will be kind and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. and gracious to me.</p>
            <p>When good Deſires were raiſed in the Heart of the returning Prodigal, when he aroſe and came to his Father, when he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, and ran and fell on his Neck and kiſſed him; then he humbled himſelf before his Father and ſaid, <hi>Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son;</hi> I have ſpent that portion thou gaveſt me, among Harlots in riotous living. If thou returneſt as the Prodigal did, and if thou addreſſeſt thy ſelf to thy heavenly Father as a true Mourner, with a ſincere repentance never to be repented of; if thou ſetteſt thy ſelf in good earneſt to ſeek the Lord early and late, thou ſhalt find him to thy Souls ſatisfaction: For ſo the Prodigal returning to his Father, and making theſe acknowledgments to his Father, it moved his compaſſion and fatherly Bowels: His father did not chide him and upbraid him, but fell on his neck and kiſſed him; <hi>And he ſaid unto his Servants, Bring forth the beſt robe and put it on him; and put a Ring
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:135138:103"/> on his Hand, and Shooes on his Feet; and bring hither the fatted Calf, and Kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my Son was dead, and is alive again; and he was loſt, and is found.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the joyful Entertainment that the returning Prodigal found with his indulgent Father; ſo when we return to God, our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, by true repentance, he will receive us into favour, for the ſake of his well-beloved Son, in whom he is well pleaſed: We ſhall be ſtript of our filthy Garments, and be cloathed with the Garment of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rhe Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, and be found in him not having our own Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and we ſhall be feaſted with the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Calf; we ſhall by faith, feed upon the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb of God, that was ſlain and Sacrificed for us: His Fleſh is Meat, indeed, and his Blood is Drink indeed: <hi>Whoſoever eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood</hi> (ſaith our Lord Jeſus Chriſt) <hi>hath Eternal Life, John</hi> 6.51. There is a feaſt of Fat things, and of Wine upon the Lees well refined.</p>
            <p>Thus true Penitent and returning Prodigals ſhall be entertained and welcomed to their Father's Houſe; he will take them into his Banqueting-Houſe, and his Banner on them ſhall be Love, and he will ſpeak kindly and comfortably to them; <hi>Eat, O Friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly. O beloved,</hi> thus he will ſpeak to us, that our Joy may remain in us,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:135138:104"/> and that our Joy may be full, that we may rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and be eternally ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the love of God; in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of Joy, Joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</p>

            <head>A SERMON Preached by <hi>Thomas Budd</hi> At <hi>Harp-Lane, November</hi> 4. 1694.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Diſciples were greatly afflicted when our Saviour told them, He <hi>muſt go away, and that he muſt ſuffer at Jeruſalem:</hi> They being caſt down, and very ſad and ſorrowful at the thoughts of his Departure, he ſpeaks comfortably to them, and bids them, <hi>Believe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:135138:104"/> in him; ye believe in God, believe alſo in me.</hi> They had a Faith in God, they believed in God, they believed in the Light which came from God, with which they were enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet nevertheleſs, the Death of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, his Reſurrection from the Dead, and his Aſcenſion into Heaven, was not then ſo clearly and fully diſcovered unto them, as afterward it was made known. And it appears, That it was not enough for them only to believe in God, but he bids them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him alſo. And he told them that he did go to prepare a place for them. <hi>And if I go</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am there ye may be alſo: In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions, where I am, there ye ſhall be alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O glorious promiſe indeed! who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the large extent of it, and the greatneſs of his Love? That he ſhould love them ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, as to die for the Love of them; as to die for their ſakes, and lay down his Life for them, and as their High-Prieſt, become a Sacrifice. The High-Prieſts under the Law, offered the Bodies of clean Beaſts, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Holy place made with Hands. It was not without Blood that the High-Prieſt offered Sacrifice for the Sins of the People, and for his own Sins, for almoſt all things wete purged with the blood of the Sacrifices which were offered, and then he entred into the moſt Holy place made with Hands. But Chriſt being come, an High-Prieſt of good
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:135138:105"/> things to come, by a greater and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Tabernacle, not made with Hands, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own Blood he entred in once into the Holy place, having obtained Eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for us: Ye believe in God, believe alſo in me, He bids them, believe in him, as the Light of the World, and follow the Dictates, and Motions of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>You do well to believe in this divine Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, if ſo be you live in it, and follow the divine Motions of it; O then it will be a Sanctuary to you, as the City of refuge was to the Manſlayer under the Law. There were ſix Cities of Refuge appointed in the moſt convenient places of the Land, for the Man-ſlayer to fly to, if any one had killed a Man at unawars, againſt his Will, there was a City of Refuge to have acceſs to: If he could get into that City of Refuge, he was in ſafety from the Avenger of Blood, from the Purſuer; if he was over-taken by the Avenger of <hi>Blood,</hi> then he might be ſlain then he might be deſtroyed; but if he got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City of Refuge, there he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in ſafety, in ſafe cuſtody, under the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard and Protection of the Law: But if he went out of the City of Refuge, then the Man-ſlayer might take hold of him.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are written for our Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Lord hath provided a City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for his Children and for his Servants to fly unto. And what is this City of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge? It is the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:135138:105"/> Light of the World in its firſt Miniſtration of Gods Holy Spirit. If ſo be you fly to it, and come under the Protection of it, it will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve you in ſafety: But if we depart from our Obedience to this Heavenly Light, then the Man-ſlayer, the Juſtice of God, will take hold of us; then we ſhall feel the Wrath of God to be kindled againſt us, and ſmite us, and cut us down.</p>
            <p>And this we have known by living Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, while we have remained under the Protection of God, and under the ſafe-guard of the Law, and of God's Light in our Hearts, we have been in ſafety from the Avenger, from Gods ſevere Wrath and Juſtice; God's wrath hath not been kindled againſt us, to burn us up and conſume us; but if we have been rebellious and diſobedient, then the wrath of the Lord hath been kindled againſt us, and his Judgments executed upon us. But when we have run to the City of Refuge, under the divine Protection, we have ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened our Hearts and Hands in the ſight of God.</p>
            <p>But if we have ſinned at any time, then our own Hearts have accuſed us and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us; We are to remain under the ſafeguard of the Law, until ſuch time as the death of our great High-Prieſt, Chriſt Jeſus, be revealed in our Hearts; when we have heard the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſound, when the tidings of the Death of the High-Prieſt comes to be ſounded in our Ears, when the Myſtery of Chriſt crucified comes to be revealed unto us, then we have
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:135138:106"/> a glorious inheritance to go unto, a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable poſſeſſion beyond all the Enjoyment of this World. The ſtate in Paradice, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Man was at the beginning, is not to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> compared to it; it is in the Country we are travelling to, the Spiritual and heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land flowing with heavenly Milk and Hony, Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, This is the Country which we are travelling to, if we believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and follow the great Captain of our Salvation. Who was made perfect, through ſufferings, we ſhall be made Heirs of Eternal life.</p>
            <p>Let us believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is gone to prepare a place for us; In the time appointed of the Father, he will come again and receive us to himſelf, that where he is, there we may be alſo.</p>
            <p>O bleſſed are you that have a living Faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and do follow him, and the Conduct and leadings of his divine Spirit, and he will lead you to this heavenly Country, he will go before you; and he hath made this Promiſe to all his faithful followers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I grant to ſit with me in my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſate down with my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on his Throne.</hi> He is the Bridegroom and you ſhall be the Bride, the Lambs Wife, And you ſhall be joyned to him in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Marriage Union, and you ſhall be with him in Glory to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We Read, Gen.</hi> 82.24. <hi>that Jacob being
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:135138:106"/> left alone, there wreſtled a Man with him all Night, until the breaking of the Day; and when he ſaw that he prevailed not againſt him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He ſaid, let me go, for the Day breaketh, And Jacob ſaid unto the Angel, I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me; And he ſaid unto him, what is thy Name? And he ſaid, Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. And the Angel ſaid to him, Thy Name ſhall no more be called Jacob, but Iſrael; for as a Prince haſt thou Power with God, and with Men, and haſt prevailed: And he bleſſed him there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, my Friends, if you would have the Bleſſings of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Bleſſings of <hi>Abraham,</hi> O then wreſtle with the Man Chriſt Jeſus, and wreſtle in Faith; wreſtle with this Angel of the Covenant, all Night, until the dawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Day, until the Day-Star ſhall ariſe in your Hearts; and not only ſo, but perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in the Faith, until the Son of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ariſe. As <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled with the Angel of the Covenant, Chriſt Jeſus, who is both God and Man, he wreſtled with him all Night, until the dawning of the Day: Then he bleſſed him; <hi>And Jacob called the Name of lhat place Peniel; For I have ſeen God Face to Face, and my Life is preſerved.</hi> He ſaid, a Man appeared to him, and he called him God: How is this to he underſtood? The Man Chriſt Jeſus, he is both God and Man. None but he that is both God and Man, can bleſs us with eternal Bleſſings; therefore, let us believe in him, that can ſave to the uttermoſt, all that come unto God by him, for he hath obtained Eternal Redemption for us.</p>
